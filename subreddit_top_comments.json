Did you feel overwhelmed or were you very confident?"

May I ask how long it was from the time you started learning to program until you were in a position to look for a job?I am near the beginning of this path and, like you, am interested in a web developer route. I also do NOT have a CS degree (I'm a lawyer) and am teaching myself Python in my spare time (HTML/CSS/JS are next on the docket).My wife suggested that I might think about ways to translate my skills as an attorney to the world of software development when the day comes for job interviews. For example, I am trained to understand complicated legal and regulatory schemes and break them down  into parts and explain them to lay persons. I know how to write in a proscribed language and syntax (ever hear of 'legalese'?) in order to attempt to produce a desired outcome. I am trained to read and understand long, complex text that is often self-referential and has a looping structure that contains LOTS of conditional logic (i.e. - laws and regulations). And I know how to take a big project and break it down to small, manageable steps that must all fit together to complete a larger task. Do you think there is any value in t any of that, assuming that I build the knowledge and portfolio to go with it?"

Shirt, tie, suit if you can!I disagree strongly about this for software engineer interviews. This is largely dependent on the company, sure, but I've done a lot of face-to-face interviews now with 5-person companies to super giant companies. If you dress in a suit and tie, you'll actually be overdressed and viewed less favorably by your interviewers.You ought to aim, instead, for one \"notch\" better dressed than what you'd typically wear to work at these places. For a typical software engineering interview, a guy is fine coming to an interview in jeans or khakis and a button-down shirt and a woman can wear whatever the analog of that is. If you're interviewing for FinTech or at some old school place, a suit and tie might, indeed, be a requirement. But for most places, your advice is bad in this regard."

It's horrible.The other day, I had a small chit chat with the ice cream seller, while waiting for my Smoothie.To my surprise - He told me he loves his job, and doing it for almost 6 years.It blew my mind! Not because it's weird to enjoy selling ice cream or something -But because I didn't think people are actually waking up in the morning WITHOUT wanting to die, regardless of the type of their job.Right there and then, I realized that I'M DONE.  For the last couple of days (since quitting my unbearable job), I'm thinking about going into \"Python\".I've seen a lot of people write about it as well - Except most of them already had experience working in High tech.That's why I didn't believe I had a chance.You really gave me hope and faith.Thank you for that, and best of luck!!!!"

I’d like to demonstrate my coding skills but at the same time protect my code that I’ve spent countless hours of researching and writing.

You really are an inspiration, I hope to one day be posting a similar story here. Treating learning like a full-time job is something I'm definitely interested in as I'm currently taking a gap year with supportive relatives.  I read below that you were formerly working as a manual laborer, do you have a formal education (a university degree)?  Also, I'd love to hear where you were hindered in your learning journey, i.e. rabbit holes of resources, books and such that were not worth your time, so as that I can avoid them.

Im gauging because i know about a good portion of what you written about (although i still think my coding skills suck) and waana know my general worth...(even though your in England and Im in cybersec)Edit: also good tis on dealing with pesky recruiters. I havent had to deal with them for about 2 years but since im getting ready to quit. I forget how much of a headache and slimy (at least in the US) they are."

I cannot do it and when I try to find clues on internet people is talking about complicated things that I didn't read. But the book is amazing and teaches you how to build up little projects."

I ask because I have always (naively) answered the question of how much I currently make and I feel like they use that to literally halve my pay since I seem like a push over. Maybe I'm just paranoid. It would help me to gauge from your experience. I can take a PM if you don't want it public. Thanks again!"

And my friend is a junior software engineer right now and has inspired me to self teach as well reading your post has sealed the deal and it is 100% what I am going to do.But basically, one of my projects is to build a website for my dad for his driving school and again I have no knowledge of this so far.

Its a goal of mine to join the military but in the meantime I want to learn other avenue's before embarking into the navy So I took the initiative and decided to enroll back into junior college. Got classes for a fire tec and wildland firefighting. But the fire tec is from jan 4th — Feb 14, hybrid courses. While the wildland is in March 14-18th. In-between I want to work on getting knowledge on front end developing.I recently borrowed a book from the local library to begin with HTML, CSS and some HTML5.I am interested in Js to but want to learn python as well. I feel Js is more  prevalent for jobs here in the US. But python does have a nice salary to go with it. I wanted to ask how long it took you to go through your self study's that ultimately landed you a job?  Like from your first days to you attaining your first job?"

I've been back and forth over the last couple of months to years about what I want to do with my life after thinking I knew, and now I'm kind of back where I started. I'm pursuing Python development, but I got so frustrated trying to figure out whether or not boot camps are worth it that I'd rather just try and learn it myself. Thanks for all the information you've provided here."

This post was made 5 years ago, do u think this path is still relevant, like the source materials from where to study ? Would u change something in your path now in terms of learning materials ? Because it has been 5 years maybe there is a different approach now and strategy"

I have found the answer is usually no, you will find some junior adverts occasionally, however roles that I have seen that require 1-2 years experience I have still applied for with a good cover letter as I have had some companies get back to me saying they would be prepared to interview for a junior role.Tell recruiters you are also looking for a junior role, as I have found they may call the company managers directly and find out if they are prepared to proceed with a junior level role.I have found junior roles range immensely, from 23k-50k. I have been told many times what you get offered depends on how well you come across and how well you do in the technical test.I am due to start soon. Only just accepted my offer but will definitely update!"

The ones who came in wearing a suit and tie never seemed to relax in the interview and that did go against them in terms of how we saw them fitting in with the team. In all honesty it didn't actually matter to us what someone was wearing though, if they came across as relaxed, confident, engaged and assertive then they would be fine, for some people they will do that naturally wearing a suit and tie, for many people they won't and it doesn't reflect well in the interview. It also comes across as a cultural thing in regards to how the business operates, if I interviewed somewhere that expected a shirt and tie for interview then I really wouldn't want to work there in the first place as I wouldn't fit in with their culture, this is a two way street so I would never even bother going to interview if a suit and tie was required and would reject them as a possible employer."

I always used to say \"let me look at the website/company in more detail before I send my CV over\" that gave me an hour just to reflect before giving the go ahead."

Decide which area of python you want to specialize in then become tunnel focused.Data science is a different area of python compared to django.Knowing when you're ready for a job takes personal confidence in your own ability. Take a loot at job advert postings and look at the requirements. Do jobs require a specific framework? pandas? numpy? etc. Learn one in good depth, build a project in it. And only put on your CV what you can genuinely answer questions in depth about.Did I know I was ready for a job 8 weeks ago? Absolutely not. I gave it my best shot. If it didnt work out I was prepared to go back to the drawing board for another 3-4 months, build more projects then apply again. All interview experiences will help you learn even if its not a positive outcome!Good luck!"

Generally, for most engineering positions (and especially software positions), that means business casual, and jeans are usually fine.At best, wearing a suit and tie would be viewed as silly at virtually every company I've interviewed at (in both the engineering and software worlds), and would not be seen favorably. There are exceptions, of course, but they constitute a minority. If it's for a management position, though, a suit is often appropriate, but not for a developer or individual contributor.As a general rule, I always ask my point-of-contact at the company (usually someone from HR) what kind of dress is expected/appropriate for the interview. Can't go wrong this way."

It’s very unusual for anyone at any level to wear a tie. Pretty much the only time you see a tie is in a court building! In almost a decade, the only times I have worn a tie was twice, for interviews. Haven’t worn one since, and probably never will again. I work with people at all levels of business, right up to top-level political offices and a tie is not required nor expected.Bottom line; do your research on dress code!Incidentally, I thought your advice for speaking to recruitment consultants was very good. If they ask you about other jobs that you have applied for, it’s purely so they can go and contact that company to get candidates in there; you may end up not getting a job because they put another candidate in! I was an IT recruitment consultant for a short time, and I also worked as IT Manager for a recruitment company. I know all their tricks! It’s just sales; most don’t care about the candidates (although there are exceptions).Well done on your hard work. I hope you enjoy your new job."

Inasmuch as you are evaluated by what you wear, and we seem to both agree that you probably are, you should dress the part. Too fancy is too fancy just like too casual is too casual.

I started with Python, because I understood it's one of the most powerful programming languages, but after 6 months I switched to Html, CSS, Javascript. Now I am teaching myself React, Gatsby. I have started applying for jobs since last month and have got zero answers til now. I find it hard to actually practice what I learn, which tells me I haven't learned it well enough. I want to produce a project that will attract recruiters to me. I would love any advice you can offer."

I was thinking you simply did not sleep for an entire year; work during the day, code at night.Still very impressive progress. For anyone reading that cannot simply quit their job. Try and wiggle your python abilities into your current job. Is there task that could be automated which will reduce wasted time at work and boost productivity? Automate it, show your manager and stick it on your GitHub."

Some people might read this and think they can do it while having a full time job, kids and a rent/mortgage to pay. You managed to learn something while living rent free and getting all your bills paid by a family member. That is a luxury that most people can't afford. You should've started your story with this. I've actually not met any 30 years old men that can afford this. Was your family member paying for food everything else? When you take all this into account - is your story actually that impressive? You don't see students who've had their university fees and rent paid by their parents making a big deal out of the fact that they managed to learn something.The impressive thing in this story isn't the fact that you managed to learn something in one year, but the fact that a 30 years old man managed to find him self in such an exceptional circumstance which allowed him not to work for one year and not starve himself to death."

I've seen way too many self-taught stories where the person has an engineering or science related degree which kind of skews the idea of whether a truly self-taught programmer from any background can get into the field.I hope to see an update post in the future when you start at the job. :)"

My script took the files and sorted them into nested folders year > month > day based off the meta data of the picture that stated what day the picture was taken.  And it was so much easier to keep track of and find things, and instead of unloading the camera daily it void be done weekly or once it's almost full.  That was 5 years ago and I'm still proud of it."

It's the same thing, over and over.When we create a tool to do these things, we get excited, because all the frustration gets released when the script runs. Other people don't have this reaction, because they didn't experience life without the tool.Explaining your creation to someone that has no use for it will always end up like this. They have no common ground, and therefore can't have empathy.This is not your fault, and it's not theirs, either.You can come here and share, and we'll give you praise and high fives, cuz we've been there.Keep coding!"

Just gotta implement a functional file locking system and then that last part will be automated. I freaking love python.Although the open ended nature of it has led me astray from conventional design patterns and has me shaking my damn head at how sloppily I’ve thrown everything together."

Soon you'll be addicted to writing automation scripts for everything. You're just scratching the surface in terms of the joy you'll have with programming.Remember that you only need to figure out something once, and once you do, you'll be able to implement it really easily (just look at the source of your script), making you more and more efficient with every program.I took a look at your script, and I'll provide you with some criticism. Do not take this negatively, but instead as an opportunity for feedback.* `driver.implicitly_wait(int x)` \\- according to documentantion, this function dynamically waits for DOM elements to load before searching them, not for things to download, and that's why it won't wait for the file to download.* Using a simple `time.sleep(int x)` to wait for a file to download is suboptimal: what if the file takes more than the specified seconds to download? Instead, try using a loop that waits for 5 seconds and checks for the file, that will continue to wait if the file isn't downloaded yet. This is probably not very important in your case, but it's good to know possible breakpoints in general.* This is more of a personal preference, and many might disagree, but I believe you're overusing comments, especially in `rename_file.py`. I believe your code is cleanly written, and as such, self-evident -- there's no need to clutter it with comments. If you feel like they help, then by all means ignore this advice.Either way, this is a great start (definitely better than mine lmao)"

One text file stored content from previous run and other stored content from current run.After collecting data, it compared the two to each other. If there were no differences, it would just overwrite the old file. But if there were differences found, it would send me an email, alerting me of the differences. I was super proud of myself for coding that piece."

I really resonate with your comment, and I literally have thoughts going in all directions with my code and ideas for tons of different things. Upon trial and error, I’ve developed my own system that may help you:Write down everything you think of. Every thought that you don’t want to forget. The anxiety of being scared you’re gonna forget your good ideas is very real for people with lots of thoughts running marathons in our minds. I’m about 2 years from graduating with a B.S. in C.S., and I’ve picked up on some things here and there, but there’s real power in actually writing down every idea/thought of “Is this the best way to do this?”, “Is this how I could approach this?”, “How will this work if I do it this way?”, “I think this will work, but if it doesn’t, how can I find an alternate way of doing it?”Writing down all of these ideas, questions, and thoughts are how I “problem solve” when designing my code. This for me is a way of thinking through things and evaluating multiple ways of implementing certain data structures or algorithms. It also gives you a general direction of the way you want to write your code, and eliminates the anxiety/worry of forgetting your tiny unique way of implementing something. I use a big white board and take screenshots of all my thoughts before I erase it to keep thinking and writing before I start to write my code. That’s the gist of my design process and workflow. I hope this is helpful and if value to you or anyone reading this thread with similar issues. I’m just a 22 year old, intuitive, high-functioning autistic guy pushing through my goals to succeed as an example for others, and I won’t be successful unless I share what I know to give back value to others, so I’m happy to help.Just do the best with what you’ve got and what you’re given until the right opportunity. Success occurs when preparation meets opportunity, and I can attest to that. I’ve used a system with notecards for setting my goals that has allowed and continues to allow me to prepare properly for a Java Midterm. I ended up making a 100 on it and a 94 on the Final. I’ve done my other exams the same way. Clearly defined goals are definitely the way to go. The main issue for an individual is not a lack of time, but a lack of direction. My DMs are open to anyone in CS, and anyone that also has ADHD and struggles with their coding process. I’d be happy to offer advice to anyone while drawing from my own experience(s). I hope this helps."

It's why I can't really sit down and learn anything with a lot of depth or difficulty unless I'm in the rare right mood for it or am really into it in a certain way. Learning to code is one thing I flirt with the idea of like twice per year but nothing really comes of it. But even that aside, what I'm most jealous of is your ability to generate a flurry of ideas. One significant reason I cant get off the ground with learning is that I'm utterly blank on reasons or things I would want to use it for. No ideas, no projects, no nothing. But I've got forgetfulness in spades, so it's like all of the drawbacks and basically none of the positives, hence my jealousy."

If the same script is to be run once per day however, you can spend up to 5 weeks (840 hours) building and maintaining."

That said, there's something missing from that last chart, an emotional dimension, a personal satisfaction dimension.The problem I have with these metric charts is that they don't include the joy of learning. I'm no professional coder, so, while I know a bit of code (enough to be dangerous) but not really enough to snap stuff together like Legos.And, I hate UI design. I'm more apt to just do it all from the CLI, instead of actually writing an app.There's the trial and error, the frustration, the looking up references, the testing, all before I get a workable script that at least runs and does what I want it to.There is a satisfaction and fascination with getting a script or program to work that has a value all its own."

Or is the expectation that you'll be Googling and finding things that haven't been taught in the book yet?I know that in general in programming StackOverflow is your best friend and it doesn't always matter how a problem is solved as long as it works, but for the sake of learning, it seems to me that if I have to go outside of the course material to try to solve the problem, then it means I haven't properly understood the course/chapter material. Am I wrong?"

So anything from graduation requirements, scheduling classes, contact information, parent teacher conferences, etc. My most recent python script saved my team a whole week. Every year around this time, we have to audit transcripts by eye to check which students are on track to graduate on time by looking at the amount of credits per subject they have (which means literally looking at each kids’ transcript, determining which classes belong in which subject, adding the credits up and putting it into google sheet document we share). This is over 500 kids and typically takes 5 of us to complete over the span of a week while we all do other things and even then humans make errors.So back to Python. I wrote a script that reads the entire PDF file of transcripts,  pulls all of the classes and their credits for the class they took for each kid, puts it into a pre-existing excel sheet that already has formulas to categorize each class by subject and then tallies the total credits and uses conditional formatting to highlight the classes for which students are behind on credit. So we went from a 1-week task requiring the entire team to a one day task requiring only me. My boss and coworkers all gifted me a shit ton of gift cards and praised me. I can probably automate enough to the point where we don’t need one my more useless coworkers."

Learn a lot along the way. Some employers maybe just want the widget you can produce. But many MANY great ones are more interested in the employee that can create them. Don't let anyone measure your worth by some widget you wrote. Especially yourself!This is just one thing in a long career of problem solving and software development. If you waste the time you saved the company pretending like you're working you're not showing them that you're worth more."

It’s quick and familiar..)Downsides are it’s easy to mess up formula and calculations & there’s a maximum number of rows.Another thing is a database can do sophisticated joins between different types of data: think a list of authors to a list of books- you want a single place for each of these things without duplication.The language SQL allows you to ask astonishing things of your data- if you learn how to use it!  it might a bit of an unfamiliar way of thinking but practice might make you see how clever it is. (Codewars.com has puzzles in sql & python (& others) you can level up on.)For db recommendations: Postgres is probably more than you will ever need but I suggest SQLite to get started. It uses a file to store your data in, in a very tangible way. Eg: Makes it easy to nuke the database (on purpose!) & start again with a new exercise.Mongo I would argue is a special case of sql. Once you get the broad concepts of sql, the pros & cons of not using it will be more obvious. Ymmv & there’s definitely a place for both in your repertoire. ( I suggest redis as a no sql db too fwiw)Looking forward to hearing about your journey- & Congrats on your code: All about solving problems - good job!"

                "comment": "Different db management systems have different advantages. SQLite is nice if your data is completely local as it doesn’t rely on a server-client model which can be a little slow starting up and takes up some resources in background. Others like postgresql are good when you need remote access. I know nothing of mongodb so can’t speak for when you’d want that. DBs are nice when the size of the data is large compared to your ram. They make it easy to read in small subsets of data and work on that rather than trying to read in the entire dataset. They also handle relationships between data efficiently. When people talk of dbs they’re generally referring to relational databases which can grab data from multiple tables in a single query. So if you’re keeping track of who’s accessing your office you might have a table with columns for an employee id, a room id, and a timestamp. The employee id and room id might not mean much to you so you’ll have an employee table and a room table that will associate other data like name, role, email, etc. That way you can ask who entered this room (by room name) on some date and get the names of the employees without having to redundantly store that information in every entry in the main table. And db management system do all this very well. They can sort by an id then do a binary search instead of going down the entire list and keep indexes to find other columns.That being said if the data is small enough compared to ram you may be better off using csvs and a programming language (many have libraries for working with tables in a SQL style like pandas for python).As fat as what can’t excel do? Excel is great as an all in one for someone who doesn’t know much about computers but, IMO, it is way over used. It’s intended to be like a simple programming language but as soon as someone starts putting significant time learning it they’re probably better off learning the basics of a high level language. The actual reasons it’s not so great: it doesn’t separate data from code making it not easily reusable (workarounds require copy templates and pasting data into them), this also means it can’t do anything to the original data without destroying it which means leaving around lots of columns of data, and it also means storing calculations on the original data rather than saving the results meaning recalculating values often, it displays everything all the time and auto updates which is inefficient to the point of being a bottle neck, it doesn’t have proper variable names or easy to create functions making it hard to follow what has been done (i.e a bunch of As and Bs in a cell isn’t very informative compared to sample_id and cell_type, it’s not plain text unlike programming languages so it doesn’t work with plain text tools  most notably version control software, it doesn’t scale up well either with complexity (a programming language allows you to break functionality into other files and packages) or with amount of data (again dbs allow you to read in small fractions of the data if it’s too large), plus Microsoft doesn’t support linux which is popular amongst people doing data management/on servers so it’s a pain to convert to another form and that can lose information.For working with table data R’s tidyverse packages are the best I’ve used. A ton of thought has gone into what people really need to do to the data and things work intuitively and pipelines are clear in function and easy to throw together quickly."

It native to Python (via standard library `sqlite`), easy to use, doesn't require a server/host since its just a single file, is efficient, fast, and ACID-compliant. Learn it once and you learn it for life.For automation, there not really any better solution for a backend.I, like you, didn't mess with databases but I forced myself to try it out with a project and it's a serious game-changer. It does have some limitations (eg, concurrency, clustering) but nothing that can't be overcome with some clever engineering or pivoting to another type of backend (MongoDB, for example)."

Worst case from being honest is devaluing the work you're doing, and by extension the work of anyone else doing roughly the same thing, driving down wages in your industry for the benefit of bigger dividends to your customer's shareholders. You decide which is the more honorable stance."

I had already done some python tutorials, but your course helped me feel more confident and i figured out that i can do everything with all these available libraries.As an office employee i coded many scripts which helped me \"automate the boring stuff\". I had to put more than  200 stamps and signatures on pdf files. So i made a script turning them to jpg and then copy the sign and stamp jpg file and paste them. I made some web scrapers as well and i gather data. Now im exploring data science and going to start a new project soon with the data im gathering. Also i was accepted for a msc in data science.You have my deepest thanks."

Both the book and the course are worth every penny and I'm so glad I found them. I started learning python from scratch using a little free android app, but I ended up just migrating over to ATBS because the concepts are explained way more thoroughly in your course. For anyone starting out with python, I 100% recommend this course."

As a broke high school student, I wasn't able to to afford your course so I've been looking forward to June where I knew your generosity would pull me through. Thank you so much.Once I finally have the funds available, expect a hefty donation by yours truly and I absolutely cannot wait to continue learning with you! You are a blessing in the python community and personality helped me feel a sense of accomplishment during times like these."

You need to know how to program to maneuver through different databases as well as visualize them.Furthermore you need strong interpersonal skills as you need to know how to effectively communicate your results to your product manager or team. Sadly in top tech companies there’s much politics to play in these roles.Idk about a graduate program, I’d take a look at the admissions requirements for the specific program you’re looking at.Considering the question asked id assume you’ve got a bit of an incorrect picture of how this job works and what it looks like, id consider watching some YouTube videos. As a project manager for IBM the data scientists on the team were given a task then they went off into corners to code and weren’t seen for hours. To move up in the field in this position you have two options, masters or PhD, or, going into product/project management and focusing on the corporate ladder. Hope this helps!"

So I wouldn't worry about any syntax you forget over a two-day period.What's way more important than memorizing syntax is knowing what you can do as a programmer:* I can store a bunch of items in order, using a list.* I can connect pieces of information, using a dictionary.* I can write code in a function, and use that code any time I want.You won't forget these big concepts. When you decide which concepts you want to use to tackle a given problem you can look up any specific syntax you need to implement a solution. You'll probably find that you start to remember syntax for the concepts you use most often, and you'll end up looking up syntax that you use less often. I refer to PCC, and many other resources, all the time when working on my own projects."

As with most things in programming, there are situations where classes are really helpful, and situations where other approaches are better.One reason I will always teach about classes in Python is that you will use classes all the time, even if you never write a class yourself. Many of the libraries we use are structured as classes, and we create objects from those classes. For example when doing data visualization work, the figure you're creating is often an object of a class. Then the data might be an object as well, each axis might be an object...It's hard to say anything about your 3k-line script without seeing the code, and learning more about the context for that code."

I keep intending to take the plunge and register a copy of Illustrator and design them a little more carefully. But I know they're useful as they are, so I wanted to get them updated first in their original format, and then consider a redesign. Seeing the overwhelmingly positive response here is motivating me to take that step."

I'm self taught and always considered myself more of a scripter and code stealer (not programs but looked something up and then copied and modified for my use case). I can read a lot of code and piecemeal little things together. When stuff starts becoming more complex then I struggle. I understand ifs, for loops, simple arrays, functions but there are little nuances in code that are over my head that make it difficult. I'm a finance guy and been in finance for over 10 years. But have always loved coding. I would have done it but I hated the class I took in high school.. probably a teacher. I want to learn python for data analytics and because my home automation software is written in it. I guess I just keep learning my doing!"

I think it was great to start with yours since it really made me start coding on the go. With Lutz's I understood more in depth concepts and it's been a great complement to yours. After reading both yours and now Lutz's I have made summaries that just come very in handy with your cheat sheets whenever I forget something or need a refresh."

I spent several hours today making a simple “guess the word” game where one person types the word and the other has to guess it. It’s pretty much useless but it works and I’m proud I am back in it. Now I feel confident I can move on to bigger things."

                "comment": "You're quite welcome, and I'm glad to hear they're useful.I won't be adding another sheet too soon, but one of the reasons for updating to a proper graphic design format is so I can continue adding new sheets over time, and update them on a more regular basis.Fun story: I like Indesign because it has scripting capabilities. I wanted to create one long document with all the cheat sheets, and then write a script that dumps out the whole document in color, then dumps each individual sheet, then does the same thing again with the b&w styles applied. That way I can update once, and easily regenerate all of the sheets in both styles.But like many desktop apps with proprietary scripting capabilities, the language is...not entirely fun to work with. Indesign uses a language called ExtendScript, which is based on JavaScript from the mid 2000s. It hasn't been updated in a very long time. I found myself wanting to write code like `if current_style in styles_to_change`, but found that the language doesn't really have that kind of test. So I came up with a convoluted approach that examines the string name of the current style against the string names of the styles I want to change, and then followed a strict naming convention for the styles I was developing in Indesign. It was like doing an overly ambitious pattern-matching exercise using only strings and arrays. I was very happy to return to Python when this work was finished. :)"

Before, I'd just coded it as:print('Which one is your email providers: Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook?')emailServer = input()The same question above email providers actually relates to the bug I've been working on since Friday. My user input fails to go through my list of if statements to match the email provider :if emailServer == 'Gmail':     emailProvider = 'smtp.gmail.com'I'm thinking that putting those email providers in a dictionary like your cheat sheet shows may solve the problem. I just haven't been able to apply that theory yet."

The most challenging part of making a set of sheets like this isn't really choosing the information to include; the real challenge is fitting that information into all the little boxes, and using all of the space well.So I'm not planning to reformat this information as a website. An online pdf viewer might be an option?"

My first thought is that it would make the sheets too busy and take away from the clean layout. But I'd be quite open to hearing what others think.When I first made these, I developed them in Word and then saved them as pdf for distribution. It worked, but it left artifacts in the conversion process, and it was really difficult to update the sheets on a regular basis. The first version of these were popular enough (1.3M downloads!) that I redid the entire set using Indesign. People had requested printer-friendly versions for a while, so one of the goals of that iteration was making a black and white version of the set.We're all programmers, so I looked for a way to automate the conversion from color to black and white. It turns out Indesign (and most of the Adobe suite) ships with a scripting language called [ExtendScript](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/extendscript-overview.html), which is like a 2000s-era JavaScript. I wouldn't call it a fun language to work with, but I was able to write a script that does the full conversion. So now it's relatively easy to make minor updates and fixes between full revisions.All that to say I could see making a version that uses syntax highlighting for those who want it, and keep the original styling for people who like the cleaner version."

The only reason I could imagine intentionally choosing an older version is if you're working on a legacy codebase.Here's a summary of [what's new](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/new_in_3e/) in the third edition. The most important updates are in the testing chapter, and in the projects section. Everything in the second edition still works, but the updates in the third edition are significant.I've been telling people that if you have the second edition and you've already started, it's reasonable to finish working through that edition if you can do so in a reasonable timeframe. If you haven't started yet, definitely work from the third edition."

I couldn't find a book that made no assumptions but spoke to you like an adult. So that's the book I wrote.I also didn't like the approach of dumping everything about the language into a book. We have extensive online reference documentation now, so you don't need a book or course to teach you everything; you need a course that's well curated. The guiding principle of Python Crash Course is: *What's the least you need to know in order to start working independently on your own projects?*  It has worked well for all kinds of people, and I've heard from many readers who have learned programming mid-career to either change jobs, or do their current work more effectively.Even if you don't learn from PCC, I think that's a good mindset to keep when selecting a learning resource. Don't try to learn everything; learn enough to start applying the principles you're learning to your own work."

If you're working on a large, active, distributed project it can certainly be challenging to use. But for personal projects it's really easy to work with once you get a little practice with the fundamentals of init, committing, and branching. And, on a personal project, you can always back up your entire directory if you're worried you'll mess something up. You shouldn't do that often, it misses the whole point of version control. But if you're going to try a reset or rebase command for the first time, you can back up the entire project first, including the .git/ dir, and try these commands out."

I found a good walk through in the comments of the lesson, but this is an important step that could really use some explanation.Thanks a ton, this has been great so far and I'm eager to continue!"

Your course took my Udemy virginity. It is sooooo good. It has a clear direction (to automate boring stuff), instead of a broad vague direction. Other Python courses are trying to feed me every single detail and want me to become a Python master, but I always give up not even half way because I don't know what to do with all this info overload. Like \" yes print('blahblahblah') will do this, but what do i do with it?? where do I even type it???\"Thank you for creating this course with learner's perspective in mind."

These are sorta bad pieces of advice. \"Work on projects\" *is* good, but the advice doesn't help you decide what to work on. And a lot of open source projects aren't very friendly to outsiders. It takes a lot of onboarding to get started, even for experienced devs.I've created a bunch of small, simple, text-based programs (mostly games and animations) for people to use. My idea is that you copy the code directly, run it, make adjustments, and then try to recreate them yourself. You don't need to memorize the code, just the make your own version of it. It's stuff like Blackjack, Tic-Tac-Toe, mad libs, etc.https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogamesThere's a time after you learn the basic syntax, but still don't \"know how to make a real program\", and this is called *tutorial hell* or *the desert of despair*. Just keep working through it. For concrete advice, I'd encourage you to learn regular expressions and learn how to use git. But yeah, keep doing projects and classes and books too. If you want to learn computer science stuff in particular, the thing to google is \"data structures and algorithms\". [Coursera has a good free course called \"Algorithmic Toolbox\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/) that you can do. It's basically a freshmen CS course."

                "comment": ">AlternativelyAs a beginner in data science (I have 2 decent matplotlib programs behind me), I disagree. This should be learnt first it just makes your life so much easier. Lambda functions work great with things that require a key/function, such as comparison based functions (like sort, min, max) and operation based functions (like map, reduce, filter) or to more simply name a function that does a long computation, but doesn't deserve the def keyword. It's a confort I use a lot.I haven't found a opportunity to use *args **kwargs yet, but at least knowing how to create a keyword argument with a default value can be pretty useful. Generators and list comprehensions are very useful tools that help your code be cleaner, more efficient. I don't think you should learn something like np.arange or np.linspace if you can't understand code like list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(20))), as numpy isn't going to replace that (if you don't understand map, you wont understand very well what is an array squared, as I think this is how you do it).Also, you can learn these stupid fast compared to the time it takes to grasp a big package like numpy, matplotlib or pandas.Also, basic knowledge of useful modules such as itertools and collections. There are so many programs that would be much worse if we didn't have deque and other useful things from these modules (like Counter, product, combination functions, etc)."

I set up a quick VLOOKUP script in excel which auto did the task (albeit more accurately since it was hundreds of items). Took less than a second to do what took her 8 hours. She told me she was finally able to the rest of her work done on time.This wasn't anything complex and a simple fix.

The more we automate, the more we as a whole can be free. In reality this is not the case; we live in a society where people live to serve the bottom line, and not other people. Toying around with automation is fun, and can help free up a lot of time so that you can do more things you enjoy, but just be VERY careful with disclosing your automation work to others, as I have seen time and time again how it can negatively affect other peoples lively hood. If an organization gets even a whiff that a job can be automated, they will do it, cut loose the employee, and MAYBE give you a pat on the back for \"increasing efficiency.\" Efficiency be damned."

It should be followed by \"so that should free up some of your time to work on X, Y, and Z.\"A lot of the blame falls on the employer that didn't put enough effort into develop their employees - but some of the responsibility is on the employees themselves to be open to learning and diversifying their skill set. You were able to do that in the same environment that she wasn't.OP - Don't be too hard on yourself about this. You didn't set out to eliminate a job - you set out to make a job easier to do. And you succeeded brilliantly. Had your company not already been looking to get rid of people, this would have instead been an opportunity for her to take on more interesting work and develop new skills.Definitely ask for a raise. You've earned it. But once word gets out that you're the reason your coworker got axed AND got rewarded for doing it, that might not play too well.

Don't do this for many reasons as people have mentioned including legal or criminal issues you open yourself up to. Besides -- it probably isn't necessary. &#x200B;I did something similar once. It didn't involve a person losing their job, but I automated a task that took 6 human hours and got it down to 5 human minutes and like 5 machine minutes. Massive time savings. Was very proud of it. Got a small raise out of it. It became part of my team's usual process.(in retrospect, I should have demanded more) &#x200B;Then one day they laid us all off out of the blue. Outsourcing scenario, etc. Immediately turn in your laptop, leave the building, etc. I was crushed. Never had happened to me before and I felt like I had been doing great work.&#x200B;What they didn't know was that I was using a third party API to manage part of the task I automated. I still had access to that API and could see that they were making use of the script I put together.  Then I noticed a ton of errors being reported. Honestly? I don't know why it stopped working but I assume it has something to do with the fact that I never documented its use fully (since I figured I would always be around if questions came up) and eventually they just stopped trying to use it. Don't create self sabotaging code. That's a great way to lose trust. If you think a business doesn't appreciate you, get out of there, don't compromise your integrity. If you want to gain leverage, tell them other cool ideas you could implement and remind them that they'll need someone to maintain these things. Code rarely lasts forever, especially in places where human processes are involved and you need to account for an ever growing list of edge cases."

While I don't think you did anything wrong, I think there's a lesson here for the future; is xyz action going to automate someone out of a job?  If so, are you ok with that?  It's an exercise we so often forget to do when we \"just want to make things run better\".  There is a real recession out there with real people facing a dead job market and massive lay offs everywhere.  We're largely untouched by this in the technology field; but it is genuinely rough out there.  OP, I think you caused some collateral damage and didn't mean anyone any harm; you're definitely not a bad person.  But now that you have this insight, personally I think it's something you have to weight in your actions going forward."

What else can you do? You saw a problem and dealt with it, there's no malice there. Hopefully the company is taking care of her too though by giving plenty of notice on elimination of the position (or severance equal to it).

Going paperless and reducing hand entry is a big killer too.  When you find out someone is printing a report out of one system, and then keying it into another, and you have direct API or DB access to both, that task can get automated really quickly and a 30 second script can eliminate half a persons daily duties."

The flip side to this is that the more automation happens, the more jobs get created elsewhere. For example, If computers didn't exist, programming wouldn't exist. All of today's programmers would be doing other manual stuff that computers are now doing & society would be worse off as they're not working on new innovations.It's all part of a great balancing act. Human level AI will soon be doing what you just did on a scale far greater so don't sweat it. Ideally, at that point society will then start to work on other projects and new jobs (or new purpose, since it might not be \"work\" in a traditional sense if AI is doing it all) should open up as a result. That's the utopian version at least. Could end in mass poverty and unprecedented inequality far far beyond even what we have today globally, if our political systems can't keep up and wealth from machines work isn't redistributed."

It was a much much easier task to automate than yours though — like I did it all overnight.  Suddenly they had a dozen people to reallocate.  As it turns out, the store has a ton of projects that can be automated like that, so luckily nobody had to go.  That said, I could do every one of them on a similar fashion.I feel like I need to fight for a raise and to have a new position that actually includes things like this, but I fought for years to become a repair technician which complicates things.  I had to to a lot of the ground work myself for repair-as-a-service to even be a thing that we do, and if I do something else, they might dissolve that."

                "comment": "At my previous job I automated a report that was essentially the deltas between two inventory systems. Before I did that my manager would compare and combine two spreadsheets exported from the inventory systems by hand. It normally took three days and he did it once a month.Once I came on-board my manager handed the task off to me. The data was fairly straight forward. Two spreadsheets, one had one line per item number with a field for quantity, the other had one line per each individual item (so if we had five of one item, that's five lines) and no quantity line.After about an hour of actual coding, and a little refining, I had a working python script that took a three day job and turned it into a job that only took a few seconds. We did make a few tweaks to the script to add in some additional fields later.Word got up to our upper management and eventually our clients (we were contractors) about my automation and I got some kudos (but no raise >:( ). No one lost their jobs or anything but company and clients were very happy. We began to get requests for the report to be run every Monday morning instead of at the beginning of each month.One day the client sends in someone for an audit of the warehouse and he's going off on this great new report that they've been going off of and I thought to myself \"Oh they must have gotten someone to redo the reports that we submit to them\". But no, he handed me my own, completely unmodified, report. I found it kinda funny.After I had left the company I heard that because they didn't have anyone that understood what the script does (my guess is they wanted to make some modifications) they stopped using it all together and went back to doing things the old way... oh well. HA!"

When the automatic weaver was put in production a lot of people lost their jobs too because a machine was now doing their task more efficiently. My point was this, automation isn't here to replace you, it's here to *free* you. Meaning, if you don't have to spend all your time doing repetetive tasks you have time for more useful things, more projects, more development. A person who has X amount of years in an industry and Y amount of years in a company (beyond their education and so on) should become MORE valuable to the business now that their time is freed, not less.Perhaps since you were the one to automate her job you should be the one to remind the company of that?"

After a while I automated it completely but kept it to myself for a while.Then one week I forgot to run the script (it needed some manual input) and instead of insisting it would take ages to do I had it done in minutes. From there it all went downhill... Now I lead the daily operations while identifying key areas for automation and improvement. It's a good gig, but this is the first time my actions have led to literal downsizing.

I blame part of this on the employers, for not ensuring that staff are working effectively, but place at least as much blame on the end-users who seem content to ‘do it the way it has always been done’, and to not even attempt a simple Internet search to resolve even the simplest of problems. In most cases, they could literally type their question into Google (e.g. “How do I automatically change the colour of a row in Excel, based on its contents”; that’s a fairly common question that I am asked).If people who use office applications can’t be bothered to help themselves with the most basic of issues, then they should expect to be replaced by automated processes, or by people with appropriate skills.I have ‘automated myself’ out of a few jobs over the years, but it was no surprise to me. I used the skills that I learnt, to become more valuable to other companies.Office workers are often referred to as “Knowledge Workers”, but I think that’s a misnomer in most cases; they are simply button pushers.I do understand that not everyone has the ability, but my experience is that most people just want to be ‘nannied’. People do and will continue to lose jobs because of automation, and more people will require social funding to survive because they are simply not intelligent enough to do ‘knowledge’ jobs; I advocate for that support, but have little sympathy for those who are able and don’t make any effort to educate themselves."

Ask for at least half of that. You're likely going to get less than half, but it makes it hard for your boss to rationalize paying less when you come at them with real numbers."

In many cases this was a side task for an employee who did more stuff, and it was eventually welcomed that they wouldn't have to do it.  In some cases you had a person that was more-or-less exclusively doing that, and had been fairly resistant to learn other skills.  Sure they knew the location of a bunch of stuff, and the names of the people, and maybe the history of the company.  But their actual skill was tracing a wire, pulling it out, running it to a new location, and using a punch down tool.  The fact that they had internal knowledge in the company wasn't going to help them to suddenly be useful as a programmer or an admin or engineer.  In lots of cases these people just ended up retiring.  You're not going to pay them for their charm and historical knowledge alone."

Among the work he was asked to perform was the creation of spreadsheets that the company was using to manage equipment orders.The spreadshees included custom scripts that would update the content of the file based on current orders stored in other, remote documents, allowing the company to automate inventory and order management.But while Tinley's files worked for years, they started malfunctioning around 2014. According to court documents, Tinley planted so-called \"logic bombs\" that would trigger after a certain date, and crash the files.Every time the scripts would crash, Siemens would call Tinley, who'd fix the files for a fee.The scheme lasted for two years, until May 2016, when Tinley's trickery was unraveled by Siemens employees. According to a report from Law360, the scheme fell apart when Tinley was out of town, and had to hand over an administrative password for the spreadsheets to Siemens' IT staff, so they could fix the buggy scripts and fill in an urgent order.”https://www.zdnet.com/article/siemens-contractor-pleads-guilty-to-planting-logic-bomb-in-company-spreadsheets/"

This idea that you just aren’t a “computer person” and then expect the economy to keep paying you the same as we go further into the computer age is going to become more disjointed and is a big part of the inequality in incomes in the US these days.

Retraining needs to be as cheap and easy as possible, companies should be provided with incentives to retrain existing staff instead of sacking and hiring new ones etc.Raise taxes on the wealthy folk who make their money from every day workers, and use that money to fund extensive education programs."

Cynical side coming in - your company would have kept your colleague if they really wanted to.  They'd have moved her to a different department, they'd have done something.  And it's rough, but it wasn't like you were in command of the discussions about who to keep and who to chop.  Companies and workplaces, big and small, are using the pandemic as a bit of a smokescreen to, essentially, drop people for whatever reason they didn't have before.As somebody in the job market right now, it's pretty rough.

Some because they are lazy, and some because that’s all they’re looking for in a job, or perhaps it’s just a personality trait (I know plenty of people who are more ambitious then I am)! Life opportunities also affect the way we think about our own abilities; I know plenty of people who think they are only capable of a doing a ‘basic’ office job (because that’s what they have always been told they are capable of), but who are definitely capable of excelling with the appropriate education and encouragement. Mostly women fall into this category, in my experience, because of ‘social norms’.However, there are definitely people who don’t have the ability; it’s something that I didn’t really start to appreciate until I was in my 20s, and did not grasp fully until my early 30s when I completed a degree in education (I’m in my 50s now). An example might be two administrative staff doing the same job; filing documents, following ‘paperwork’ processes, entering data in Excel, etc. one of the two may only have the mental capacity to follow the instructions, whereas the other may see opportunities for refining the process, or even learn how to automate it, either taking the initiative themselves, or asking for training. I see these scenarios fairly frequently.My wife is very good at spotting ‘talent’, particularly people who underestimate their own abilities; she is in a relatively high-level technology role in a government department, and half of her team were previously ‘non-technical’. Given the opportunity and training, they have excelled in their new technical roles, bringing their expertise from other domains.There are always some people who simply don’t have the ability, but there’s a place for everyone. I remember wondering, when I was a teenage apprentice, how the guy who swept the factory floor remained sane doing such a simple task all day every day. After a while, I learnt that he was very happy with his job; he did it well, and went home at the end of the day knowing that he ad fulfilled his duties.One of the main problems in work-life is the people who have reached the limit of their ability, but think they are capable of more. They can be (literally) dangerous in the workplace, or can cause major problems with morale. Similarly, people who are prompted beyond their ability (and left in the role, rather than being ‘managed out’); they can cause significant negative issues within a business. This is a common phenomenon known as the ‘Peter Principle’."

The company then was able to get rid of an entire position and save that money. They have no incentive to negotiate for a pay increase. They have won. Now hopefully some management are more empathetic and recognize OP’s talent and flora a small raise to keep them on, but again there’s no real hard reason for the corporation at large to negotiate with OP. It’s the hard truth."

You’ve shown you can. They’ve shown it has value to them. They’ll look at that list and imagine the money they’ll save. You just have to frame it as, “If I’m offered substantially more to do this somewhere else, I don’t want to bail half-way through the project. As long as I’m fairly compensated it’ll save both of us that pain.” Know how much it would cost to replace you and name that figure. If you put your recent accomplishment on your LinkedIn profile that will probably improve your argument. They’ll understand that if they’re not competing for your talent they’ll lose you."

They cannot remain working for a company, so the only option is for her to be separated from the company.  To get unemployment (in general terms) you need to not be working, and not be dismissed due to cause.  If they said, \"your job is eliminated\" then she would be eligible for unemployment, but similarly would not need to say she was fired from a company in a future interview or on something like an SF87 background check, since those are asking about being fired \"for cause\"."

The \"automation\" is literally parsing the filename for the index data and looking it up in our database to pull the remaining info (like account holder name, etc). This is actually what is applied everywhere, the rest is only for my department's individual use case. In that use case, opencv is used to preprocess the documents to identify the bounding box region that the account number is is stored in (a 2 pixel black border boxed in the upper right hand of the docs) as well as a few other things. All the morphology steps are done with OpenCV like thresholding, opening/closing, etc. PIL is used because I use pytesseract's `image_to_text` function, and I also use PIL and popplar along with pdf2image to convert pdfs to multipage tiffs which work best in our imaging system.

I knew there was going to be a problem in the first couple days when he asked me how to change his desktop resolution. This was on Windows XP, which is trivially easy to do. Apparently, the guy took one of those N-week \"learn to code\" classes, so he knew a couple things about programming, but only within an extremely narrow set of tools. He was absolutely useless outside using the specific desktop he was \"trained\" on. The desktops in his training course were all preconfigured, so when he got to a desktop without those tools he was completely lost.I had no part in his hiring, so I have no idea how he squeaked in. We had a manager who was terrible at interviewing, so I presume he got in that way. Our manager was so bad at hiring that he once sent an acceptance letter to the wrong candidate, so we ended up having to hire the guy. Thank the gods he was a local hire, so there was no relocation involved. He actually turned out okay for the position, but he griped a few times that he wanted a development position -- not a sysadmin position. Nobody had the heart to tell him he was a hiring mistake."

I have friends who were just told they were great, and also a friend who were constantly told they wouldn't accomplish much. Its been interesting to see them grow and develop. The person who was told they wouldn't accomplish much recently got his Ph.d in physics and is supposed to start with one of the NASA contractors soon. He always says he wouldn't have tried hard if people didn't tell him he couldn't do it. He commonly jokes that he would be working at the gas station in our hometown if he didn't get told by teachers he wouldn't amount to anything. Then the interesting one was the friend who was just told he was great and never pushed for more. He ended up getting kicked out of college and working at a sandwich shop for a year or two then ended up finishing school in some simple major. Now he's doing some kind of basic entry job and just complains that he doesn't get paid enough, but doesn't ever work to learn or get certificates or anything.It seems to be a how you view a challenge. Im on the side of if someone tells me I can't do it I will work my ass off until I have mastered it. Like all of my greatest accomplishments have been due in part to spite. But I also love learning new things and gaining new skills. I think interest plays a huge role too though. Like certain people love working in finance, but someone who is interested in biology would potentially hate it.I think the most successful ones are the people who just like learning and doing better for themselves. Improving the workplace or their life is just a byproduct of that."

Process/system improvement is absolutely a core example of this - I know a guy who saved a company 5 million in a year, on 40k a year because he worked out how to basically cut out a whole department without any problems.However, if you've provided value far above what was expected/something that isn't your role, that deserves a pay rise for doing something outside your stated terms - that's also capitalism in action. It sounds as though systems/process improvement wasn't OP's original role, so they've gone above and beyond."

Depending on the frame of mind of the manager it may come across as trying to strong arm them - some will just reject it out of principle (the caveat to this is if it the job is so rubbish/problematic that it really doesn't matter if you leave) and might make things difficult anyway. Having someone who is know to be 'looking to jump' never sits well with anyone. I'd definitely suggest coming prepared with a list of stuff that can save money, or at least some broader plans. It's best not bringing anything concrete for two reasons: firstly they might disagree with stuff (which can lead to the conversation veering off track to address what you've suggested) or more cynically they might just steal your ideas and let you go."

My manager would rather I be up front about it than put in my notice out of the blue. I’m a big believer in having an open and honest, on-going dialogue. And if you have that then it’s not strong arming. It’s making sure you’re all on the same page.I’ve had managers who would hate this though. It definitely depends."

In general terms, I would agree with you that a person who was otherwise a good employee should be offered the ability to do something else if it reasonably exists and the person wants to take it.  That said I can understand where a company might not have other open jobs or the person might clearly be unable or unwilling to take a different role.  If it's a 50,000 person company, then they probably could find something for you to do.  If it's a 5 person company... maybe not.Regarding your last statement, there is the concept in the US of constructive dismissal.  E.g. if you're a data entry worker and they say, \"you're job as a data entry worker has been cut, but we're willing to offer you $7.50 an hour as a janitor\" then you can decline and still get unemployment.  In this case if the company tried to battle that, the employee would (should) be found to be constructively dismissed.  A counter example would be that you're a programmer who works in language X and project Y, and that project gets cut.  The company says, \"we're dissolving the project Y team, but offering you a position at the same rate on the project Z team that uses language X, or something reasonably close to it\".  If you were like, \"nah I only wanted to work on the other project\" or \"I only will write in Python, I refuse to switch to Java\" then they could boot you and would be unlikely to have the unemployment hit, since the new job offer was substantially similar to the old one."

This is not necessarily the case.A business, particularly a large one, is a highly effective machine, that has grown through iteration to a profitable point.You usually can't just set up shop and expect to earn the same. You need sales,  marketing, account managers, accountants, lawyers etc etc. Like I said, it's really difficult to be all those things for your self. You end spending way too much time on things that are not your core business.Of course, going small, you can work as a consultant, which is probably the best for most people.

As a manager in tech for over 20 years I can tell you individuals who pull tactics like that are easy to identify and at my company get put on the short list. 1. They don’t get promotions. Why? Well if you promote them then who is going to support the code they produced that keeps breaking.  They are locked into the low level position.  While the code is problematic. 2. They don’t get important projects. Since what they have is unstable.  Often times they only get simple grunt work beyond their main project. 3. If there is a downturn they are usually the first to go. When your losing people you want the people of most value, those are the people contributing to the company not those prioritizing their  own value. They are flexible and people you can give a lot of different projects. Also they are often easy to replace, someone can review your code and the people you keep will figure it out in time. 4. From my experience those who play these tactics have little to offer the company long term. They hold on to a few contributions they make and have little to offer beyond that. However, people like OP is someone you want to nurture and encourage. They identified an issue and didn’t just report the issue but came with a solution.  I’d want them to fortify their code so it’s robust, then identify a new issue/challenge to them. It’s unfortunate that their co-worker May loose their job. I would suggest that they talk to the manager about retraining that person for a new skill."

The book shows techniques which can make you to do real useful staff  with Python. On other hand it doesn'rt teach you to program at all and encourage to use really bad coding style (sequential programming). Like an [example](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter6/) below    # English to Pig Latin    print('Enter the English message to translate into Pig Latin:')    message = input()        VOWELS = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'y')        pigLatin = [] # A list of the words in Pig Latin.    for word in message.split():        # Separate the non-letters at the start of this word:        prefixNonLetters = ''        while len(word) > 0 and not word[0].isalpha():    prefixNonLetters += word[0]    word = word[1:]        if len(word) == 0:    pigLatin.append(prefixNonLetters)    continue            # Separate the non-letters at the end of this word:        suffixNonLetters = ''        while not word[-1].isalpha():    suffixNonLetters += word[-1]    word = word[:-1]            # Remember if the word was in uppercase or title case.        wasUpper = word.isupper()        wasTitle = word.istitle()            word = word.lower() # Make the word lowercase for translation.            # Separate the consonants at the start of this word:        prefixConsonants = ''        while len(word) > 0 and not word[0] in VOWELS:    prefixConsonants += word[0]    word = word[1:]            # Add the Pig Latin ending to the word:        if prefixConsonants != '':    word += prefixConsonants + 'ay'        else:    word += 'yay'            # Set the word back to uppercase or title case:        if wasUpper:    word = word.upper()        if wasTitle:    word = word.title()            # Add the non-letters back to the start or end of the word.        pigLatin.append(prefixNonLetters + word + suffixNonLetters)        # Join all the words back together into a single string:    print(' '.join(pigLatin))Now I kind of understand why many questions posted in that subreddit have that style of coding.(I expect to be downvoted, Tnx)"

                "comment": "Here's a list of requirements for the programs in my book:* They need to be short, preferable under two pages, because the longer the program is and the more page flipping it requires to view, the easier it is to lose the reader.* It needs to have as few layers of abstraction as possible, because the more layers of abstraction it has, the easier it is to lose the reader.* It needs to use a minimum amount of programming concepts, because the more concepts the reader needs to know the more likely they won't understand the program.* It needs to be a complete, runnable program (not code snippets) that amuses the reader for a couple minutes after they've copied the program, because otherwise the reader won't see a point to the code and won't be motivated to continue learning to code.* It needs to be simple, because the more complicated it is, the more likely the reader will be intimidated and give up on programming.* If there needs to be trade off between code elegance and reader comprehension, the decisions needs to favor reader comprehension.* And a few others, but this list getting to long.These are not the same requirements you'd have for commercial software, because this book has a different target audience. It's a program with 33 lines of code that translates English into pig latin. I'd say it does have structure and functional decomposition, it's just that it has as much structure and functional decomposition as it needs.This program has a lot of structure:    public class HelloWorld {        public static void main(String[] args) {            System.out.println(\"Hello, World\");        }    }...compared to this:    print('Hello, world')But schools (and software companies) moved from Java to Python precisely because \"structure\" often turned out to be \"boilerplate\". Anyway, that pig latin program took many iterations for me to write. Sure the first iteration worked, but it wasn't anywhere near suitable for a beginner's non-textbook programming book. It's a simple program, but it takes a lot of work to make something simple. There were also iterations where I made it *more complicated*, because it was going into Chapter 6 so I wanted to have some extra features like working with punctuation and maintaining the original case of the English words.The program doesn't have any functions, but it also doesn't need any functions. There's no duplicate code that needs to be refactored into a function. For a beginner tutorial, coming up with function names runs the risk of having the reader misinterpreted the name. Actually, functions-that-are-only-called-once is a bad habit that I see beginners make, who feel like they need to put code in functions (even for short, 33-line programs like this one) because that's how the examples they're learning from do it.When I first started writing programming books back a decade ago, I also made the mistake of using examples with functions-for-the-sake-of-functions. These are lessons I've learned over a long time. Another thing I've learned: \"bad habits\" is an exaggerated worry. Dijkstra famously said, \"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.\" Even as hyperbole this is complete nonsense: I've come across tons of redditors in their 30s and 40s who coded BASIC on their Commodore 64s and now work as competent software engineers **because of** the early programming experience BASIC provided, not in spite of it.I've learned that the most important issue about teaching people to code, and this is something that nearly every experienced programmer gets wrong when they try to teach, isn't writing elegant code or best practices or critical thinking skills or recursion or fucking whatever. It's getting people past the intimidation factor. People find programming scary. They think they can't do it, and when they fail at some minor thing or can't understand some example code snippet, they feel stupid and give up. **And their instructors take this as a sign they didn't have the brains or discipline to become Real Programmers.**I dunno, this is just one of my raw nerves. I've seen a lot of people have all these unnecessary anxieties about programming inflicted on them by programmers who seemed more concern about dictating The Way Code Must Be Written than checking in on how much their students were learning.

When you look at the people who are the progenitors of these restrictions, it’s clear they don’t believe what they are saying. My Dad died suddenly last year. I regret every missed opportunity to see him, call him, send him a text to let him know how I used one of the many things he taught me when he didn’t even realize he was teaching me.You. Do. You.

Stitching text is especially easy and gratifying (hence this project).I don't default to any one specific resource but there are plenty of how-tos all over on YouTube. I think you can also buy embroidery (not just cross stitch) starter kits. r/Embroidery is a great place to find inspiration and ask questions. They also have a beginner's guide.I'm still a beginner myself but here's some of what I've learned:- Use a sturdy fabric, like canvas or denim, to avoid warping.- Keep your thread an arm's length or shorter to reduce tangles.- Knots happen so keep tweezers around.- For text/clean lines, use the whipped backstitch! You'll always have the cleanest lines in town. ([link](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zbok06w_txo))Best of luck to you. :)"

After some time I got some guys I was responsible for and planning was becoming my thing.The system to plan the work was horrible and we could not really do internally a lot because decisions of the maker of the machines we maintain. I needed to go three different sites, tick some fields, look data here and there. Every week rinse and repeat for hundreds of machines.I got frustrated and automated one site with VBA + Python. Then another. Soon I added some other automation to my planning program. And then I started planning stuff by automating stuff which was not needed per se.My manager got interested how on earth I am leading double the amount of guys others are and doing a lot of extra customer care, financial budgeting and whatever on top of that while others are burning out with less.Fast forward few years and a lot DAX, Power Query, VBA, Python, ERP development, API development, technical documentations, leadership trainings, financial trainings and shit and I am responsible for over 70 guys, my pay check has doubled, I am still under 30 and I've got no idea wtf has happened. Feels good though and pretty much every day I learn some exciting stuff. Sometimes it is still some DAX or Python, but more and more it is some financial or law stuff somewhere. I really love my work, and as a some kind of leader of sorts I don't have time for everything I'd like to. Nevertheless my little programs I code every so often help me in a lot of little things I do every single day."

Some people would say I'm in \"tutorial hell\". I would call it \"I-mostly-do-not-know-what-I-am-doing\"-hell. English is not my main language and reading documentation almost always have me thinking \"What does this word mean\", spending time googling that specific word and then forgetting it as soon as I've read it.Coding something that other people may find basic can take me hours. I can sit in front of my PC and code (*cough* troubleshoot *cough*) for 16 hours straight, go to bed annoyed that it doesn't work, sleep terrible because I keep thinking about why it wouldn't work, and then eventually have trouble sleeping because I think I've figured out a solution and be eager to try it the next day. When I actually make something work that can save our company a lot of time, I'm thrilled. So proud of myself, even though I probably spent way too long on the code.I have no idea how much of the code *actually* works and I'm a bit afraid that being able to shit useful code out of my ass in no time would take the joy of coding (again: troubleshooting). Being able to show my boss something and tell him \"i made dis\" and hear that it's actually useful is just great!"

                "comment": "Nice!! Congrats.If you're going to do more of these types of automation projects, I would highly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the re package in python. Regular expressions are a hugely powerful tool in text processing and can help you identify and manipulate data. For instance, if your account numbers didn't always start with the same three digits, or those three digits could show up elsewhere on the page, you could say \"111, followed by dash, followed by six more digits\" like re.search(\"111-\\\\d{6}\",mypage) or \"\\\\d{3}-\\\\d{6}\" for any three digits followed by dash followed by 6 digits. Hugely powerful.There's a book that's pretty well regarded called \"Automate the Boring Stuff using Python\" which may give you a lot of boilerplate to work with.As to the out-of-memory -- difficult to say, loading a 3800 page PDF is probably a good chunk of memory but python is supposed to consume as much system memory as it needs, at least in 64-bit versions.You may have a better development experience prototyping your code in Jupyter Notebook, which you get automatically when you install Anaconda Python.  It lets you run small chunks of code in a web browser and inspect your stuff in-flight. Then you create your .py program in VS Code once you're done experimenting in the notebook.If you were running your code inside VS, it's possible it forked a process for you with a lower memory ceiling -- you should be able to open a command line and just python [yourfile.py](https://yourfile.py) to run it directly and see if you run out of memory.You can also either add command line parameters to tell it what file to run, or use the os package to look for files (like the file with the greatest date in a folder) so you can set your program to run and not have to worry about manually editing and running it.There's a whole new world of python automation out there for you to conquer!"

Reading your post is actually really motivating and it visualizes why learning Python (in this case literally) pays off and is no waste of time.Even though it sometimes takes until 3am to find a solution, that time time was well spend. Why do something manually in six minutes when you can waste your time trying to automate it in six hours?  Because those six hours learning are still well invested, just like compound interest: the new insights and skills will repeatedly pay off in the future and the so saved time can be used to learn some more"

I feel you, when you say you were beaming, it is so much fun when your build completes or the program runs successfully after spending what seems to be an eternity writing your code.Your issue seems to be with memory management while using Loops and the best solution for it is to use 'yield' instead of 'return' which can be done using a 'Generator'. Though the concept is fairly simple (it handles your iterations automatically) but you will have to understand the concept of 'closures' and 'first class functions' to understand how it works.If you want to try it out 'just replace \"return\" with \"yield\" in your loop' and try to run it.If you are interested to know more i would recommend Corey Schafer's  youtube video on generator,s his was the first and the only video i needed to watch to understand closures,firstclass functions and generators."

That is a wonderful example of someone finding need that other people didn't realize was there, showing initiative, and, let's say it, kicking-a\\*\\*!  I worked on a problem similar to your own long ago and while I did not use PyPDF2 I found a couple things you want think about as they may help in the long run. First was my script grew come a simple automated data collator to something closer to a 24x7 data QA process.  One big thing I found, even though everyone said was not possible, was where you had PDFs with \"Page 1 of x\" was to keep track of which pages had been processed and how many pages the overall PDF was to being with.  My old script would find, at times, two PDFs that had been munged together some how so one PDF might have \"Page 1 of 14\" though \"Page 14 or 14\" and then \"Page 1 of xx\" right behind that - in the same PDF.  Whatever it was I used to process all this, and I apologize, the code that I was is behind the firewall at a financial institution never to see the light of day, the first thing I would do say gather a list of the actual number of pages and make sure that the page headers agreed with that.. and I would keep set of unique page numbers that were processed, i.e. if somehow your PDF happened to have two \"Page 3 or 26\" that was important to flag.  I only point that out because that ended up being a HUGE win and one that was applied to YEARS of digitally archived PDFs looking for such errors.  I wish I had some information on how to deal with memory on Windows instances but unfortunately I do not.  I've always been in the Linux side for this kind of stuff.Congratulations on your success and it's awesome that your boss sees the value you created.  Believe me, your boss?  He's already touting it too his boss and it's going up the food-chain.  This could be something fun to continue to do with a slice of time from your work day or, who knows, you could one day, and maybe not long from now, be leading the group that does this kind of thing for the company full-time.  The beauty of automated job like this?  The run 24x7x365.  And like that guy from the Terminator said (paraphrasing): \"That script is out there. It can’t be bargained with. It can’t be reasoned with. It doesn’t feel pity, or remorse, or fear.  It finds errors and validates data.  And it absolutely will not stop, ever, not even after you are dead.\""

You can either loop once or loop once to build a table of indexes which you then use to split up the document. One loop is faster, but doing two looos where you just build up a table of IDs and index’s allows you to go back and error check before you generate a bunch of documents."

The real problem in this situation is the company that generates the report in a clumsy and hard-to-process format. Additional work is required to manually process that whale of PDF at your workplace. And you had to stay awake till 3AM for the same reason. It's worth at least talking to your boss about escalating the question back to that company about them considering to change the format of the data they provide. Generally if upstream causes some trouble, if it gets raised there and improved/fixed somehow, everyone wins. Imagine the scale of the problem if that company is providing the data not only to your employer, but to 1000 or 10000 other companies.2. Now that your code gets to work with real data, not only your salary raises. Your responsibility raises too. One bug in your code and you'll get to take the blame. Upstream data provider slightly changes the data, which won't be a problem for those who process it manually, but could be a problem for your automated processing by code - and you end being the guy who takes the blame again. Software has bugs sometimes, it's normal. Software has to be adapted sometimes to new data formats. Even if you're at the very beginning of your programming/particularly Python programming journey, learn from the start to mitigate such troubles to a certain extent. Writing some unit tests for your code is a good further investment of your time into this project."

If it was created completely in your personal free time (time you didn't log on your timesheet) and your employer didn't request it, it's yours--not your employers.  If you log it on your timesheet, it's your employers.  They didn't ask you to make this and you did it on your own time, that makes it *yours*.  Not sure how useful it would be for it to be yours, I'm just clarifying that it is.  At my office, if I knock something like this out I can go back and log it on my timesheet as hours worked and leave 5 hours earlier on Friday or something.  Not sure if you can do something like that, just something to think about.It sounds like you'll have support at the office now, so anything you create at their direction and on their time now is theirs, obviously.  I'd still recommend keeping it somewhere else other than just your laptop so that there is continuity in the future if you leave.

As a fellow financial worker who has to pull data from PDFs, you may also be interested in [Tabula-py](https://pypi.org/project/tabula-py/). It's pretty easy to use, and can be useful for liberating data from pdfs. You can build templates using a GUI and then export them to python to pull the data programatically. It's a wrapper for java, so you'll need to install that as well, but even though Oracle is switching to a paid model for java you can find free, open source builds. [I use this one.] (https://adoptopenjdk.net/)It's also nice because when one of your templates stops working (say a client changes their PDF format), you can visually debug the issue. It's been a godsend for me."

But we've spent about 40 hours between three people going through these, and we were about 25% done. So we probably save 120 hours? Programming is so fascinating how you spend x amount of hours to automate something and once it works it just takes a few seconds or minutes (for this simple stuff) to actually do the task."

My colleagues had a list of ~120 biotech/pharma companies and split it between the 4 of us to find interesting products by looking at their websites one at a time. I instead used a list of >10,000 medicines in development or already on the market, developed a list of my CEOs preferences (scores of 0-10), and then filtered the thousands of individual products through these preferences. Before they finished going through their lists, I had a comprehensive rank-order list that could be immediately updated to match a change in preferences, and could also be updated every quarter when our vendor updated the drug list. Some of the top contenders were products we had already licensed, which validated both my process and the history of the organization. Feeling like I had conquered the world and was about to get recognition, I showed my team of peers, including my boss who was roughly my age. They were not at all excited; in fact they questioned the use of my time and asked me to catch up to them using their format. Later I created another tool that allowed us to type in the name of any drug sold in China and it would print out a report including graphs, etc. showing recent sales trends, competing companies, and even competing drugs in the same space. It was idiot-proof since all you had to do was type in the name and hit enter. Again, they questioned the use of my time rather than adopting my tool that would have hastened their work. So disappointing."

Our scanner has OCR, and the files always go to the same folder. But we have to take these, create a new folder, and then a sub-folder for the account. So this will wait for new files to come in, scan for the name and account number, and sort the documents. It'll split the PDFs between New Account forms, ACH forms, and other types that come in.And I'm meeting with the team that manages the API of our CRM that then takes the files once their sorted locally and upload them to the servers."

Honestly, an IDE is like a pair of shoes. You need to find one that fits you. I tend to the old school, so I prototype and do most of my analytics work in notebooks (Jupyter), then transition code into production formats using VS Code.  Your mileage will certainly vary, but in my opinion many of the bells and whistles in an IDE serve to support large scale team-based application development and may be overkill for smaller automation type projects like this. I would counter your boss's statement that the code should all remain on the laptop. Given the value you're creating, I would at a minimum create a *private* GitHub repository and push your stuff out there routinely. Stuff can and will crash, vanish, get deleted, and get corrupted. Protect your investment with source control. Do not let grass grow under your feet on the offer to finance a degree, especially if you don't have one now. I think Illinois has an online CS degree through Coursera, their CS department is a great mix of value and reputation. Congratulations again!"

But, what are some specifics that you as a senior dev would look for? Actual areas that in a project, you want to see utilized. What kind of projects matter? Should I keep making calculators, or should I try to do some AI tutorial project off Udemy. Essentially, what specific areas (and since you're going to be answering questions for 12 hours I'm gonna be a punk and ask this) would you expect to see someone be proficient in as a beginner, intermediate, and expert in python (or programming in general)? What are some \"Wow, this dude knows his shit\" projects that you've seen? I hope this makes sense, but as a slightly more than beginner, beginner, I get so frustrated when people say \"make something you'd use\". Ok, well, there's a million possibilities.

My questions are -1) How does one remember which library and which module to use for a particular purpose?For example - I know of 2 http libraries, Requests and Urllib3. These libs have many modules in them and i know there are many more http libraries available. I usually go through their documentation/stack overflow while writing my code. I mean if you give me a pen and paper (no internet) and ask me to write a python code, i feel really really difficult to write one, unlike C codes which i can write easily.So, do most of the people go through documentation/stack overflow everytime they write some code?2) As mentioned earlier, I've worked on flask framework and beautifulsoup. My reason for working on these is -I learnt python to work on flask 'cause my previous company asked me to. They had some project, that required flask.And while i was on YouTube, i came across web scraping. I then came to know of beautifulsoup and i found it interesting.My question is, I want to learn something after work and I'm not sure where to start from, as there are no requirements and i just want to learn. Should i go in depth flask and beautifulsoup? Or should I just go with any one of these libraries like openCV, tensorflow, pandas, pycharm, tkinter etc.P.S.- I'm not a computer science person, I don't come from that background. I've recently started working in an electronic company that deals with IOT and M2M products. I've seen people working on opencv and tensorflow. C was quite easy as i knew what i had to learn, i mean it's very specific. Kindly help. And sorry for the long post."

I've been working in my current field for about 13 years now. Problem solving is a huge part of what I do, so it's encouraging to hear you say that it's one of the better qualities to have as a programmer.At the minute I'm struggling to workout for/while loops and how to properly arrange them but I'll cut myself some slack, it's only been a week. I can explain them I just don't know how to program them.I'll be keeping an eye out on this post. Thanks for doing this."

So I'm basically new to python (primarily coded in c++, java for a couple of years). That said, I've picked up the basic syntax, did some exercises on things like dictionaries, list comprehensions, lambda functions, basic OOP. Now what are some things I should move on to (or learn more about) if I want to create a firm grip on the language?  2. Alongside other things, I do plan on using python for machine learning or AI in general. Is the syntactical knowledge of python enough for this purpose? I've tried to like, say, basically import some libraries (numpy, pandas) and use some functions to print things out. That's about it. I was wondering what more I'd have to learn in terms of programming to able to write code relevant to ML or AI (Surely there's more to it than calling functions and printing stuff)."

I use Python to connect to network devices (using the netmiko module), and being able to connect to more devices concurrently would greatly speed up my programs. In my scripts I usually need to write data to lists or dictionaries as I get my results, but with multithreading it's so hard to make it work.&#x200B;Do you have any advice on how I could get a better understanding of multithreading and queuing, specifically when dealing with a \"master\" dictionary or list that data needs to be read from or written into?

OOP (this just doesn't apply to Python, but let's say it's a starting point), besides like one or two examples I have never really seen some good examples of OOP. Now I know **what** it is conceptually, and it makes sense. Just yesterday I used it to make a small script of two warriors who fought, but what I REALLY want to know is this: 1. How do you know when it's right to be using OOP on a project? 2. Could you provide a plethora of examples of usages of OOP in projects. The only things that even make sense for me are like GUI applications and maybe something I've done it test cases like a wallet to keep track of. Other than they, actually visualizing how I'd use OOP is a pain. As an example, this was a small script written by me and I'm wondering how you would personally convert it to OOP if you had to: https://github.com/SolidHabu/hiddenDirCheck.py3. 3rd unreleated question, what do you typically use to plan out what or how your program is going to be designed? For me I honestly just start writing, this however requires rewrites and redesign a few times over."

Feel free to answer one, many, all or none. There already is a ton of questions and I bet you're busy yourself outside of this thread so I won't take it personally. Just a little information about me: I am studying business and computer science. Well not exactly but there isn't a real English term for it as far as I am aware. Basically a lot of business stuff, project management, how to model things properly so developers understand what you mean and the models are generally easy to read and logical, some database stuff, quality management, business software, theoretical informatics, math. We also learned Java and with it object oriented programming for two semesters. Well \"learned\" as much as you do in effectively ~9 months of 5-6 hours of lectures a week plus assignments. Currently I am working at a freaking huge company for my internship and as one task came up I had to teach myself some python about 3 weeks ago. Having some knowledge of Java and the general logic you need when programming certainly helped but I'm still new to Python and more serious programming in general. Here it goes:1. There is an online game that I am playing. Since I have multiple accounts I sometimes switch between them. That requires me to completely close the game (suboptimal decision on their end to not allow a logout but whatever), reopen it, select a server, look at my file with usernames and passwords for that game and enter one of those combinations. Granted that this doesn't take too much time people always say to program something we \"need\" to actually stick to it. So I thought a script/small application which does these things for me would be cool. So I'd need to interact with that game's client/window to change the server, detect the text fields and input the relevant information. I googled and found pywin32. If you know it, would you say that that's the right library to use? Or would you advise me to use a different one? If you don't and don't know any other way to do that just ignore this question. I don't want you to do my research for me, I was just curious if you've had any experience with it.2. Something (hopefully) simpler. Say I get a json object from somewhere. The json doesn't just contain key value pairs but actually arrays. And I want to parse just one specific value which sadly happens to hide inside the array. Basically like this: {\"data\":[{\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":\"value2\", \"key3\":[{\"key4\":\"value4\", \"key5\": \"value5\"}]}]}. Now if I wanted value2, how exactly would I do that? Would I actually have to load everything else inside that array to access it? What if I wanted to access value4? Would I have to someone load that array into a dictionary? And for value4 I'd have to load originaldictionary[2] into another dictionary at which point I could access it with newdictionary[0]? Doesn't that get very slow if the json is very big? 3. About the task which I learned Python for. Just wondering if my direction was approximately a good one or if I should throw away half of it and redo it. So basically the team I am working with is working on a webservice that offers an api which, provided with the right information to the right endpoint, returns data which allows those using it to save time, make better estimated regarding pricing and other useful information. Don't want to go into much more detail for obvious reasons. So this service is sitting in (or on?) the cloud where we have a tool monitoring its performance. It also informs us if something was to go boom. What we didn't have was a way to automatically and regularly check the endpoints from a user's perspective. Basically we only knew if everything was running properly but not if people could actually and reliably access the service (unless they told us of course). That's where I came in and my task was to write a script to do exactly that.Basically my script right now looks like this: first of, to be always running it's pretty much running in a while True loop which calls a function where everything else is controlled. Probably so far from good idea that a decent programmer wouldn't even see it anymore but that's the first thing that came to mind and for now it's been working fine. Anyways, it then picks a random piece of (valid) data to send to the endpoints. It then calls the functions to actually send the data one after the other (nothing parallel). Inside each function it first picks a new UUID to send with it for tracking purposes, does a post with requests and then checks the status code of the response. If it's 200 it simply appends the name of the endpoint and the status code to a string. If it's any other code it still appends that to the string but also writes that information into a separate file, as well as the error text *and* sends an automatic mail to the responsible people using smtplib with the same information.When all of the requests are finished it opens a file (basically log.txt) and appends that string together with a timestamp. It then sleeps a time which has been set in the config.py file before looping around. Every X loops (which is determined by dividing the \"how much time should be between update mails\" through \"for how long should this script sleep each run?\") it sends another mail with information about how many errors have occurred in the last X minutes, how many requests have been made as well as more detailed information about how many errors per endpoint and the error% per endpoint and for the entire thing.All strings, information to be sent as well as error counters and loop counters are global variables because they are used multiple times throughout the script by different functions. Oh and it also deletes the entries that are older than a week so the file doesn't get too big. The errors are documented in a separate file anyways where nothing is deleted from.I think it would be way better to actually show the code than describe everything but I'd have to remove a lot of information. If you want I could do that later or tomorrow though and show that to you."

I was recently diagnosed with muscle related problems that have made my job very difficult so I had to leave the field. I have always been interested in the tech field, and have recently took up designing and developing websites that host simple games, blogs and sometimes even just the basic static pages. I started by using random tutorials then invested in some Udemy courses and am trying to get into college for computer programming (just a diploma, I'm from Canada). I have zero confidence in myself because  I've been serious about it for around 2 months now, but still have zero confidence in my programming, even though I can figure most things out on my own and with help from stackoverflow or related tutorials.Now that you have some background my question is: Can somebody like me get a job in a programming related field based on the skills I have, with or without school, and is asking for help all the time normal? I was quite fluent in my previous career and feel useless when trying to learn a new one, and quickly because I need money, it's an awful feeling!"

I then have system builder classes that act like individual robots/machines on the production line that take specified joints, and build a particular control system into them (eg a stretchy limb system, or a system to make it aim in a particular direction) the ui lets you queue up these builders in the factory, and a \"build\" button starts the factory working, triggering each robot to build its system, one at a time."

You make a variable. Need to do something more than once? You make a function. Classes have variables and functions in them. Need to do something with variable and functions that are closely related (say ... the variables are the outputs of the functions?) more than once?

The trick seems to be exactly your last question. My answer so far is when you've a bunch of functions operating on the same data, it might be clearer to group those functions into a class. ie if you've a piece of data or two that are frequent arguments to functions, maybe consider grouping them into a class. A toy example would be several functions with arguments: `car_name,` `car_data_dict` (ie `{'num_wheels': 4, 'paint_colour': 'crazy', 'human_driver': True}` \\- maybe you need that `Car` class all the toy/tutorial examples seem to use.&#x200B;The second part to that question, what should you write, as far as I can make out, depends on how you will use it. It doesn't seem to be an easy question, which of the previously referred to functions to put into your class. I've read, and so far from experience it makes sense, that you only put one 'layer' in each class. So if I've a class for my car above, I don't give it methods that do file I/O or user I/O - let it have a method that returns something that can be saved (eg JSON, or a tuple containing database fields), but have another class or function do the writing to file, taking user input etc. Another way this may work out is if you want your car to 'move' - say in a game, you could separate the car's details from 'running' methods and details, so you could have a `RunningCar` class with methods like 'break', 'accelerate', etc, while the car's more static details remain in your Car class which might be an argument/attribute of your `RunningCar` class. Where you put attributes like wear/tear level, gas/petrol tank level might be more questionable, but you can have a method on `RunningCar`, say `RunningCar.move()` update `Car.petrol_level`, if you want to bundle that data with your `Car` class rather than in `RunningCar`.&#x200B;This seems fairly comprehensible in my head, which either means I 'get it' or I have no idea what I'm talking about - I lean toward the latter. It doesn't seem like a problem with simple or obvious general answers.&#x200B;Also - the `Car` class in my example seems to primarily be a data container, it might have some methods for parsing arguments, transforming data into a serialisable/savable format, but primarily it holds data. So [data classes](https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/) might be a something to look into, as long as you understand what they're going to do for you without you seeing the code. Looking into `@property` for attributes isn't a bad idea either - but like classes, it's a 'you don't really need it until you need it' deal, although unlike classes, you can just stick `@property` on a `def my_var` without changing the code `MyClass.my_var` to access it, which is lovely.&#x200B;...the other less mentioned (I think) element of OOP over functional programming in python is the readability of `my_classroom.students[6].avatar_path` over `my_classroom['students'][6][3][1]` or similarly hard to read nested dict/list structures. \\^ in that example the Student object doesn't hold a lot of functionality, but being able to write [`Student.name`](https://student.name), `Student.avatar_name`, `Student.avatar_path` has been very readable over the alternative (even over `student['name']`, helps when you consider the cumulative mental work to parse similar constructs) and demonstrates the skill required in designing interfaces, since I originally had `Student.avatar` (and don't currently have an `avatar_name` attribute), but if I want to add an attribute/property that actually returns the image itself, rather than the path to it, I can use `Student.avatar` without changing anything else."

I'm looking for a person who can think, in a specific way, about the kinds of problems my team needs to solve.My code exercises are fizzbuzz-ish type things, and they are never live. You take them home and turn them in when you're ready. Real problem solving doesn't happen at a whiteboard or in real time. Do you know basic control flow in *any* language? That's great. You've passed the test. After that in the live interview I give general logic tests, not code tests. Can you reason your way around a convoluted business problem? I use real examples from my current and past product teams. We need product X to do Y or Z depending on some combination of AFDP and Q. AF and Q are in direct conflict with each other. Are you picking up on that? Are you able to communicate it well? Congrats. You got an offer.In other cases like when I'm hiring QA people, I'll do a pure logic challenge. In my experience, QA people have to be the absolute best at pure logic or else they are shit, and I can't stand having QA people falsely attribute causal effects. So I use this test for the real-time interview: here's the incidence of a disease. Here's the sample size. Here's the test and its accuracy for both false and true positives. If I hand you a test that's positive, what is the likelihood of you actually having the disease. I know it sounds like a stats problem, but it's approachable through pure reason without any math besides basic arithmetic. I need my QA people to be able to think like that.I don't look at social profiles, github, or anything else. I look at the person who is applying and try to figure out if that person can help me solve real problems on my team. The game changes a little when you're talking about hiring senior people or architects, but it changes less than you think it might. It's never about how well you know X language. It's always about how you approach solving problems. Senior positions are *always* about architecture.My current role uses only C# and sql server. I don't know jack dick about C#. I mean, I read a book when I started the job and learned how to make it do what I want. The bottom line is that the vast majority of jobs out there in the real world are not silicon valley-based jobs where the tech is the product. Most jobs are at companies where the tech is *not* the product, and your language skills don't matter. What matters is if you can work the problems the product team needs to solve.None of what I'm saying is going to help you get hired at a FAANG company. They are totally different. I've never worked at one before, but I am interviewing for one of those, so I guess we'll see how that goes."

It's super brief and not at all overwhelming. It helped me a lot, and I return to it often, because it succinctly describes a lot of the *reasoning* for how Python is built and most effectively used. For some reason this is the thing that made Python (and even well-crafted code in general) really click for me. It's what turned Python from just another programming language option into something I deeply love. I've even come to realize that I apply some of it's principles in the rest of my life, outside of programming altogether.I don't want to over-sell it, but seriously give it a quick look and try to keep it in mind as you learn and practice. It's an excellent way to find focus and narrow down your decision-making as you grapple with problems, and to find a sort of \"path of least resistance\" as you learn Python. It's really wonderful, or at least is has been for me."

You should know how mathy things work, like when to apply a technique and when to avoid it. But do you really need to know diff-eq or topology? Not unless your work demands it. I think a large part of the value of studying math—for our purposes, anyway—lies in the formal discipline and training your mind to think rigorously and logically. And that is incredibly valuable. I would recommend studying logic. So much of what we do revolves around reasoning about systems, recognizing logical patterns, and reducing problems to Boolean algebra. You just can’t overdo studying that, in my opinion. As for practicing python, I’d say this: wrote some code every day. Doesn’t matter how much. There’s two aspects to programming. There’s the pure mental function where you grok concepts and patterns. But there’s a wrote aspect as well and you want to develop that every day. A storm blew through and knocked my power out.

These are the `__underscore__` methods that you've seen already (defining the `__init__` method of an instantiating class,`if __name__=='main'`etc). A lot of the common syntax in Python is defined for different types of objects using these methods, and understanding them is a good first step toward learning how the language operates under the hood. For instance, ever wonder how you can use the`in`operator with both a string and a list, even though the operations required are clearly different? It's because both`str`and`list`both implement the`__contains__` method. Here's a great lecture on the [topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4).2. ML is a deep topic, and the answer depends mostly on what you want to do. Pandas is enormous, and does take some learning all of it's own (i.e., you can't just learn Python and expect to be good at Pandas for free). Basics of Pandas and Numpy will get you up and running, from there you'll be looking at the ML libraries (likely `sklearn` or `statsmodels` to start). How much goes into to it outside of gluing library code together is up to you, but yeah you can do a surprising amount by just calling `model.go()`."

All it really takes is being open to asking questions and spending some time breaking down the problem and discussing it, usually with a lot of whiteboards. One thing I would say is that programming is easiest to learn when you're actually doing it, if you're not sure how something works, get it installed on your pc and just play with it for a while. You'll learn a lot just by experimenting. If you see something that doesn't make sense to you, try it out, test it, go nuts. There is a logic behind everything and it just takes time to figure out how it works, different people are better at solving different problems so what might take one person a day might take you 5 days but it doesn't make you worse than them as its likely there are also things they would take longer than you to figure out. Work out what your strengths and weaknesses are and use that to your advantage. And never think you know everything because there is always more!"

How would you make a test to evaluate if a person can solve problems? What problems?  Any problem? All problems? In many cases just figuring out if there *is* a problem and clearly defining it is 95% of the work. True, actually fixing it is the other 95% of the work, but the point still stands. Software is applicable to literally every problem in the universe. The domains you can solve in are endless. There are people who know everything about the python programming language and spend all or most of their time solving problems that python has created! But if you send them to work at Target and say, “we have a problem with shoplifting” that same person who knows python to the core might be at a total loss. That person might be the definition of technical literacy and write perfect code all day every day. But maybe not the right fit for any given software engineering position. Can you identify a problem somewhere in the world around you? Can you do a small thing in code to mitigate it to some degree? Can you clearly articulate the trade offs you had to make in your design?

I like to separate my code by where it’s operating in the app. Is this code operating at the presentation layer or the logic layer or the service layer or data layer?"

When you do `x = [i for i in range(5)]`, the right-hand expression gets evaluated to `[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]`. However when you do `x = ( i for i in range(5) )` the right-hand expression gets evaluated as a generator object. The full data structure is not in memory, just some sense where we currently are in the (traversable) data-structure, and some way to calculate the next element in the series (`current += 1` in this case - a way to 'generate' the next value). It isn't something you'll need often for those performance reasons mentioned, but it helps to document code as well: If you see a generator, you know it's just going to be used for iteration, and so you're communicating to the reader that you aren't going to be indexing this list, just iterating through it. Does that make sense?Try playing around in a python shell to see if you can get the behaviour a bit more. Try doing `>>> (i for i in range(5) )` and `>>> (i for i in range(5) ).next()` a few times and see the difference when you do `>>> x = (i for i in range(5) )` and `>>> x.next()`"

Could you make a get_area function that just takes radius as an input? Yup! But then you dont get a cool circle object with a radius already defined. That means you can't easily reuse the data or add more stuff.    myCirc = circle(2)    myCirc.area()    myCirc.diameter() # assume we added thisClasses can also be copy pasted with inheritance. So you can do:    class Sphere(Circle):        # comes with all the methods from circle        # copy pasted in, including init!!        def volume(self):            return self.area() * radius * 4 / 3The huge benefit of this is that when you change circle, sphere automatically is updated.

                "comment": "They're super useful for code reuse, and for defining things which may have a state that changes during the course of the code execution. They're very important for graphical user interfaces for example, where you might define a general class for a checkbox, and give it attributes like color and is_checked, and maybe size and position. Then once you've done that initial definition, you can instantiate as many of those as you want, whenever you want, and change their individual attributes as needed. And your user will be changing the state of the is_checked attribute on the fly, and that state information will be neatly wrapped up with its associated checkbox. If your program needed 30 checkboxes, you'd then only have one class definition and 30 one-line instantiations, rather than 30 blocks of mostly repeated code. You could also do your instantiations in a for-loop.Similarly, classes would come in handy if you were making a game. You might define a class orc, which has a bunch of general attributes (max health, speed, strength), and then want to instantiate a bunch of these orcs when your player enters a level, and you would want their individual attributes (name, current health, position, is_dead) to be stored and updated when necessary. Classes are also great for organizing hierarchical relationships. If you were making some scientific software, you might define a class \"experiment\", within which you may instantiate and put into a list several objects of the class \"permutation\", within which you may instantiate and put into a list several objects of the class \"datafile\". This organization would make it easy to later come back and do some operation on all of the the datafiles for a particular permutation, for example."

Classes are basically a cluster of variables and functions together in teir own little box, which can -- I think most importantly -- be duplicated. Imagine you're making a GUI, and have multiple buttons on the screen. You want each one to have a lot of the same stuff in them: where it is, what text is in it, what happens when you click on it, and so on.Now, with pure functions, it'll start to get really hard to figure out what text belongs to which button, especially when you ave a bunch of them. You'll need at least 3 \"button_1_location\", \"button_2_text\", \"button_1_background\" kinds of variables for each button. That'll clutter up what you're looking at and make it really tough to change, especially if you want to, for example, add right-click functionality to _all_ buttons. A class makes this pretty easy. It wraps all those \"button_x_*\" variables into a single place. They're no longer floating around with all your other code, where a single typo might cause all sorts of problems. It means that if you need to make a new button, you usually only need to call one function (the Button function) to get everything set up.Of course, that's what classes are, but it's usually a lot harder to figure out where to use classes in your own code. For that, I'd start by looking at where you have a whole bunch of variables laying around, especially variables that aren't actually needed much except by some function(s) designed to manipulate those variables."

I'll underscore those two statements, as they've been affirmed by some fairly senior devs.\\^\\^ Code that works, is readable, is documented, is relatively easily modified and extended (ie is modular, not fragile where small modifications cause unexpected other parts of the code to break), and is thoroughly tested, is good code, whatever paradigm it is written in. I feel it didn't duplicate much code, and was reasonably comprehensible. It wasn't too hard to continue hacking on and adding functionality (I'll admit refactoring it using a couple of classes has made this aspect slightly easier). I wrote it for my wife, who's a teacher, and processes student test results into an image displaying the data with avatars rather than student names for privacy purposes. As an exercise I refactored it into OOP, and ended up with a an object for each 'class' of students (which I called `Class`, but some people might find that hard to read), and a not-entirely-necessary `Student` object. While they're both mainly data-containers, I get to write [`Class.name`](https://Class.name), [`Student.name`](https://Student.name), `Class.file_safe_name` (for a filename), `Student.avatar_path`, `Class.to_json_str`, instead of much harder to read and follow dictionaries ie `my_class.students[6].avatar_path` rather than `my_class['students'][6]['avatar']['avatar_path']` or `my_class['students'][6][1]` which is closer to what I had. &#x200B;I \\*could\\* make objects for the chart/image generator, and the generated image, but I haven't seen the need so far."

Problems in the real world often do not have clear or good solutions. A fuckton of the problems we deal with at work—no matter where you work—are problems caused by other people’s code that is total garbage, but works in a very specific way that people have come to depend on. When I say “other peoples code” I mean my past self. But regardless, now you need to do something different with your garbage code, but it also needs to stay the same. The solution to this problem is never going to be to rewrite the whole thing from scratch and do it right this time. The solution is going to be to find a compromise. Every real solution to a hard problem is partly human and partly code. Still, that’s hard to practice. But there’s an entire topic dedicated to how we find, articulate, and compromise about problems. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Read philosophy. Philosophers are smart people. They invented logic, math, and a great many other things. Plato deduced something very close to atomic particle theory without the aid of modern physics. It’s often hard to map a particular philosopher’s problem to your day-to-day life, but most of the work we do is extracting relevance from a situation and mapping it into a framework of solutions we already know the answer to. Studying how people have done this in the past is a great exercise."

Alternatively, check out the csv reader module in Python.Pandas will load your entire text file into a table like structure, and you can just directly index into the column by string. E.g.    df = pd.read_csv('data.txt', delimiter=' ')    jan_values = df['Jan']That will give you a `Series` object which more or less looks like and works like a numpy array. If you directly want a numpy array though, you can just use `df['Jan'].values`.Otherwise, using the CSV module you can use the `DictReader` class which will read each row as a dictionary, so each row you'll get something like:    {'Year': 1901, 'Jan': 1.2, 'Feb': 0.5}so you can use a list comprehension to get all of the data for a month just by indexing this dictionary, e.g.    with open('data.txt') as f:        reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=' ')        jan_values = np.array([row['Jan'] for row in reader])"

However, if you have to traverse the whole list N times (I.e., traverse the whole list for each element in the list), then you're getting into O(N^2). It's an exponential growth because you're doing N extra operations when you add a single new element to the list (well N+1, but you see what I'm saying). Does that make sense?"

That way you could make updates like:    orc4[\"current health\"] -= 5One advantage of classes over dictionaries is that you can define methods for that class. If you wanted your creatures to be able to perform a wardance() action, but wanted it to look different for each race of creature, under the functional paradigm, you might define a single wardance() function, and pass the creature dictionary as an argument. Then in the wardance() function, you could do a bunch of type checking:    if creature[\"race\"] == \"orc\":        #dance like this    elif creature[\"race\"] == \"goblin\":        #dance like this    elif creature[\"race\"] == \"human\":        #dance like this    ...Or you could have a bunch of separate functions, wardance_orc(), wardance_goblin(), wardance_human(). But it makes much more sense to me to just be able to call orc4.wardance() and have it take the appropriate action on the appropriate object. It's more than syntactic sugar I think, it shapes the whole way you organize and think about your code."

Not sure what you mean when you say Python tells you that.```def add( a, b):  res = a + b  return res```Now sure, you would just return `a + b` directly, but bare with me. To analyse this, we count the atomic operations. `a + b` is 1, assigning the result of that expression to `res` is 1, and calling return is 1. So, 3 ops. But constants drop out, so instead if O(3) we analyse this as O(1). The number of operations remain constant, no matter what the values of a and b. a == 1 or a == 2^64, it doesn't matter.Now consider a function that sums all the numbers in a list. Write that function, analyse it in the same way I've done here, tell me your answer, and explain the significant difference between it and the add function above.I've no ideas about those libraries, sorry (on mobile, might have a look later if I remember). But in general, Big O notation is really a theoretical/conceptual tool, you shouldn't particularly need any helper libraries (especially when it comes to interviews and such..).Finally, I didn't mean to say Big O is just for for loops. That's just a little conceptual crutch.  Hopefully it's clear how it applies to the `add` function, which contains no for loops. I just mentioned counting for loops because it's an easy way to tell what power of N your code is running in."

Heck, if Python hasn't crossed your mind, but you're looking for something different, easy, and powerful, take this course.  The author is a top-notch source of information and it is delivered using practical project sets rather than random projects that may or may not be relevant. He also has a few books on games programming in Python (and one on cryptography) as well on his website offered for free."

Thanks for providing such a great resource to people for free. I'll be sure to check this out. It might end up making things easier to understand because of the videos, but the book is excellent on its own."

It's no \"why questions\".  There many other ways to request advice/clarifications without starting your questions with \"Why\".  Yes, it' perfectly reasonable to ask a professional for advice and clarification.  It is also reasonable for that professional to ask for payment before giving that advice, is it not?  Yes, he's a teacher.  No, he's not a teacher 24/7.  No, he's not your personal tutor.No, you don't get banned for asking questions.  You get banned for backseating."

At present, it's designed to check once every 60 seconds and send an email to an input user if it gets a hit. I also designed it to stop once it sends a single email because it was done for fun rather than to actually get me a PS5 (which I already have).

It's a popular book and a popular course, but I also post the book free online and max out the number of free codes Udemy lets me make each month. And it's not like you have to install an app or watch hours of ads. That's not normal in today's dystopian internet.But anyway, with the RES plugin you can see the ages of the enthusiastic accounts: 4 months, 6 months, 14 years, 6 years, 3 months, 4 years, 5 months, 12 years, 15 hours. So it's not like they're sock puppets.You do see this on Amazon reviews though: glowing reviews of some crappy self-published programming book all within the same 3 day period shortly after the book's release, and the reviewers have hundreds of written reviews (most reviewers have less than a dozen) because they're bought from professional review scam accounts. I've been sitting on a blog post about it."

Though I'm sure you can buy hacked accounts with these histories; but, and this is a bit of a humblebrag, I don't need to pay that premium just to help give away a course for free.I've never done security professionally, but it's something I've always been interested in. And just like the internet made spamming profitable, and bitcoin made cryptlocker viruses profitable, and social media made troll farms profitable, dealing with scams and fake accounts online is something that we have to deal with these days. Like, I would even include Amazon as a \"shady website\" because unless you're buying some name brand thing from the company directly, there are too many fly-by-night third party sellers hocking junk to trust it, and you can't even go by reviews because there are so many fake ones.The short version of my blog post is that fake programming books often have:1. 30-word-long titles so they can catch all the keywords.2. Were published in the last three or four months.3. Have several generic 5-star reviews that were posted within a few days of each other. (And, like, one 1-star review from someone who got tricked into buying the book.)4. Sometimes you can even look at the Preview and google phrases they use to find the blog posts or Wikipedia articles they plagiarized."

Why I'm learning it? Because I want to make the setup portion of my vfx job significantly easier if I can automate it. Maybe the course will be helpful, maybe it wont, but I'm glad I can at least try it for free instead of paying and being disappointed it's not working for me. There's no need to be pessimistic - You are losing nothing by signing up or not signing up for it, and OP clearly is fine with people using his resources for free, otherwise why bother posting codes when he could be making money?"

                "comment": "> im new so i dont know what this meansProgramming has a concept, starting many decades ago with a language called \"Smalltalk\" of objects.Objects have a state, which is the current settings for its attributes, and usually methods that let you change its state or perform actions using its attributes. If you play RPGs, your character is an object, and their strength might be set to 13 or something. Your character is an instance of a class called \"RPG characters\", and there's a method (function) that you an run on this object called level up, and maybe you can increase their strength when you level up. You microwave is an object, and its default state is off, and it's got buttons you can press that tell it how long to microwave for, and it's got built-in behavior to count down to 0 from whatever you put in. You could declare a \"class Macrowave\", and give it a default setting of \"running = False\" and then make another method that says \"def run(how_many_seconds), which sets \"running = True\" and then sleeps for 1 second until how_many_seconds is set to 0 again, and then sets \"running = False\" again. Even as a beginner you should be able to find out how to do something like this if you haven't already.The op is talking about the fact that in Python, everything you interact with is actually an instance of a class. This includes really super basic types in python, like numbers. You are really limited in what you can do with them, but if I say \"a = 1\" this is actually an instance of the int class, with an attribute for its value, which is 1, and there are actually methods inside that object, like __str__() which tells other things how you represent the integer as a string. This is actually why you can just say \"print(a)\". You could compare this with another programming language like C, where you have to tell the print function what kind of object a is, because in C, a itself doesn't know how to represent itself as a string.The actual implications of this are that you can redefine certain things in Python somewhat easily. I had a program where I needed really particular behavior from a number when exiting my program, so I create a class that inherited (used as a base to build upon) from the int class. It also means you can do something more powerful, which is composition: You can make a class that holds lots of other objects, all of which do custom stuff."

                "comment": "In my opinion, OOP is great for large, self-contained projects that can be conceptualized from front to back in advance, it adds a nice organizational structure. But there are many fields where we just want to fling any operations at whatever data we feel like. If you take the functional mindset, often it will 'just work' and you less often need to go back and expand the parent structure, or reimplement the same logic in a child structure.**For OOP, the class defines attributes and behaviours for every instance to have.** (This is really the only concrete difference I can find, but the mindsets differ in how they organize logic) A class called Point2D may have attributes x, y, and a move_up() behaviour that increases y by 1 and returns the new position x, y+1.Then you define Point3D, for x, y, z. if you want a move_up() behaviour, you kinda need to define it in Point3D again, so that it gives x, y+1, z.1Dpt.move_up() -> error, method move_up not foundYou could handle this better with some forethought about a generic Point, and all the types of Points that might inherit from it. But sometimes it makes sense to have a lot of similar but distinct types, and the web of inheritance can be messy.**Functional approach ie in Julia:** Define an abstract function once, and it can be used in any case where the behaviour is logically applicable. (And if you want a different logic/behaviour, you'd better name it something else)Generic move_up(p) function, take some kind of Thing, and return its attributes after applying 'plus one' to y. There are concepts like pure functions that help organize code and logic for lack of the OOP guardrails, and higher-order functions that I really can't live without anymore, but they don't play a big role in such a simple example.move_up(my2Dpt) -> x, y+1  move_up(my3Dpt) -> x, y+1, z  move_up(2Dpt_in_time) -> x, y+1, t  move_up(3Dpt_in_time) -> x, y+1, z, t  move_up(1Dpt) -> error, y not found  move_up(horiz_line_seg) -> **x**, y+1  move_up(vert_line_seg) -> x, **y** + 1The creator of a '3D point in time' doesn't need to modify or extend 2DPoint in Time, or 3D Point, or really know much about move_up() that was implemented originally, just that it's a behaviour that they want the new type to have. When an abstract function is implemented well, it kinda 'just works' (as long as it makes sense to apply that behaviour to the data).The elegance comes from stacking operations. If + was defined that it can add 1 to a vector/array, then even if y is a vector in some new type, again it 'just works', without wondering if a vertical line segment is inheriting from a more generic Line (is Line a pair of 2DPoints, or a pair of 3DPoints, or an arbitrary length array of Points, or a starting Point, a Length, and a Direction Vector?), or an array of y's with just one x value for efficiency. There was no 'plus' defined for Points or Lines, it just has to work for basic data structures and primitive/abstract data types.There was no thinking about the line of inheritance. You needed to know that move_up exists, that it positively increments the y_coordinate, and that it makes sense to increment the y_coordinate of whatever object you want to apply it to. In the OOP, you can't move_up a 1D point because you didn't define the method for 1D points ... but if you have any understanding of what you're trying to do and why, then common sense means you simply wouldn't try that. OOP is a nice guardrail in that way, ideal for junior programmers and large teams where you don't want someone inadvertently doing something stupid without warning. But for an individual working that just wants to get to a result with as little coding time as possible, functional approaches can be more elegant."

A metaclass is an object that, when called, produces a class.`type(type(anything))` will always be a metaclass. The \"default\" metaclass is `type`, and you can see this with the rare `type` constructor.Suppose you have a class like this:    class Square:      def __init__(self, w):        self.w = w          @property      def area(self):        return self.w ** 2        s = Square(5)    print(s.area)    Under-the-hood, what's happening with that `class Square:` syntax is something more like this, using the `type` constructor. (except that I've changed the methods to lambdas so I can define them in-line)    Square = type('Square', (), {      '__init__': lambda self, w: setattr(self, 'w', w),      'area': property(lambda self: self.w ** 2)    })        s = Square(5)    print(s.area)A metaclass allows you to use something other than `type` here. `class Foo(metaclass=Meta):` uses something like `Foo = Meta('Foo', ...)` under the hood."

                "comment": "It really helps you organize things. When you create a class, as you do in Java and python (and all object oriented languages), you give the class variables and methods/functions associated with it. Then in your code outside the class, in your main method, you create instances of the class. The instance is called an object. For example, pretend you are trying to create a model of a bank. The bank has lots and lots of bank accounts, so you write a class that represents a generic bank account. The class contains the variables “owners first name,” “owners last name,” and “balance.” The class also contains the functions “withdraw,” “deposit,” and “close account.”In your main method, you create a bank account by saying account1 = bankAccount(John, Smith, 1000). When John wants to deposit money, you say account1.deposit(500). And then when you want to know John’s balance, you can access it by typing account1.balance. This would return the value 1500. And then to close the account, you type account1.closeAccount(). This type of coding has a bunch of benefits (and drawbacks). It is really helpful when you have thousands of customers and bank accounts to keep track of. It’s also helpful because a bank might have lots of other objects associated with it: customers, employees, cash vaults, loans, investment portfolios etc. Each of these things would have their own set of functions associated with them, so for example you wouldn’t ever use a “withdraw” function on an object representing a loan contract. By creating classes, you make it clear that the withdraw function can only be used on the bankAccount object. This makes your code much easier to read and maintain for the people who take over the role of maintaining that code in the future. As you continue learning about OOP, you’ll start to learn about the other benefits like inheritance and abstraction. Inheritance is when you have child and parent classes, where the children inherit the properties of the parent class. For example, you can make an “animal” class with a function like “make noise.” Then you make the child class “dog” with the function “bark.” This has some benefits with organization, code readability, and even write-ability. Abstraction let’s you call functions that you don’t need to actually understand, cause someone else wrote the function and documented how it works."

Python does not exactly “try to create an iterator” (that’s possible of an object that implements the _iterator protocol_, which includes iterables that have no size bound), instead it checks:1. if the object is a custom class that satisfies **collections.ABC.Sized** by explicitly implementing `class.__len__`.2. If the object implements the _sequence protocol_, which it may satisfy by implementing the _mapping protocol_, which is a superset.In CPython all of this is encapsulated by successfully calling PyObject_Size on a given PyObject and getting back a positive integer.The reason why the interface pattern was the local optimum for Python is precisely that ability to explicitly “opt-in” to behaving like a builtin by implementing a sufficient subset of the “magic” methods defined by the object model. With **len** there’s really only one such method, but in many cases (like **iter**) the protocol could be satisfied by a number of different paths... in both cases it was in fact “obviously better” for Python to provide a common interface and let everything that quacked like a duck be a duck, but sure that wouldn’t be a sensible choice in languages without its rich (and at times infuriatingly complex) object model."

Congrats on your accomplishment As for feeling unappreciated, I often times l work on things and use before sharing with colleagues. I use my work in ways that others can see, which allows them to see what I'm doing/how I'm getting the job done.  Sort of like the \"If you build it, they will come\" approach.Sometimes what I've done just falls off the radar, or doesn't get reaction.  If I see a benefit to myself, I keep using them. However, many times I'm asked and sought after (usually by my colleagues) to share my work process.  Most people will like change if they see it will reduce time or effort to complete a task.  If the tool/process I created is that popular, management usually finds out and asks me to make it a formal part of the job.  This may be as simple as making the process accessible from a centralized location on the network to a formal training process and docimentation. This approach does a few things:1. People don't think it just think the new process, tool, or whatever contribution just happened to appear without me having a role in its existence..2. You get recognized and respected  by your peers, and word will spread.3. You get better opportunities for advancement since you will now have a more recognized set measurable benefits you've contributed to the company.Unfortunately, sometimes there are managers who for whatever reason will not promote their workers. Sometimes it's just the lack of a supportive company culture..  I've had a few of these in my career where no matter how much you add to the benefit of the company, they still don't help you accel in your career.I'm not suggesting this is the case with you but if after all of this, if you still don't get the recognition and career opportunities, maybe its time to send out feeler resumes. Make sure to add these new tools and processes  tools you've created to it. I'm sure there are many other places that would appreciate you efforts."

So if the po line was for project completion it might look at the in service date and add 15 days for the new po due date.This task took at least 4-8 hours everytime you did it now it's 16 secs. Currently I'm trying to build operational dashboards using that data to quickly be able to make decisions or track how things are going using dash/plotly."

You may not see an immediate value to the company but this guy saved work for 3 or so people for a small task. Now with the ability, tenacity for learning, and self confidence from his previous task, he could pivot that skill for something larger, and larger, etc.. You may not be able to exactly quantify potential but you can quantify the savings when he executes on it.If you reward someone for work they now enjoy because of a new skill they are proud they picked up, they will probably give you more back in the long run than you do by move a few dollars around in the immediate future. There is a very good reason why the best way to get larger wages is to hop jobs every 3-5 years, and you’re making it easier for people to want to do that.Otherwise this guy is going to polish up his resume and brag that he successfully developed and deployed a data manipulation program to easily analyze customer accounts and saved his team time.

If she does want to learn pygame, kids can code on youtube is a fantastic resource, and after showing how to program, and how pygame works, he show you how to write a shoot em up, a platform game, and a tilemap game, each one more complex than the last.

During my first semester, I signed up for a class called Coding for Humanists, which was taught by a guy who basically pioneered computer-aided corpus analysis. I did fine in that class for exactly two and a half weeks, but then the pace *far* exceeded what I was able to absorb. So I dropped it. I dropped a coding class, which numerous people much smarter than me would have killed to have taken, at one of the world's foremost computer science schools. Not one of my proudest moments, but it did save my grades.That being said, I feel very fortunate to have been handed a free, self-paced Python course for  absolute beginners. And, of course, your books! Thanks, Al. You're a doll. And if you ever need an editor or a copywriter, you know I'll spot you for free."

Thanks a lot for making this amazing resource available to us!What is the difference between the book and signing up the online course? Also just as a bit of feedback, as a complete beginner to programming, I felt like I was flying until I hit the Regular Expressions chapter.  I absolutely ground to a halt as I became overwhelmed by the amount of expressions until I realised I probably don’t need to memorise everything to move on. The way I like to learn new concepts is probably to understand the big picture and framework and then to get under the hood bit by bit, going down rabbit holes as I go and continue to build on the foundations. I’m sure once I come back to Regex (with a specific goal in mind for a project) I will understand it better. I think introducing the concept of Regex and showing some examples to illustrate the point and leaving the deeper functionality to an appendix or back of the book might be an idea for the next version!"

I snatched up this course last time you did this \"promo\" (perhaps gift is the more appropriate word here) and as I started it I just realized, why not follow the book instead so I bought your ebook (perhaps because I want to skip over some stuff I know (and I tend to prefer book-format for courses when possible, same with Nand2Tetris & others)). Now what I wonder, is there any advantage to tagging along the Udemy course over reading the book (aside from being of help to visual/auditive learners or retaining our ravaged attention spans)? I.e., are there some important nuggets that I/we would miss out on by reading without watching? Thanks again for the great material!"

This was before cell phones, and it got to the point where if my friends called the house and I wasn't there, they'd call Barnes and Nobles and the employee would go on the PA saying, \"Would customer Al Sweigart come to the front desk? You have a phone call.\" Which is pretty cringe now that I think about it.Oh yeah, I'd also grab the entire stack of \"Free 100 hours of AOL\" floppy disks they left out for folks from time to time, before they switched to CDs.The neighborhood and school library had \"computer\" books but not necessarily \"programming\" books. I didn't have an allowance so the way I \"made money\" was asking mom for a few bucks for lunch and then pocketing most of it. A pack of six white powdered donuts was the most filling thing you could get for 50 cents. (I'm not sure how I'm alive and healthy.) It took me three months to save up $60 for a black trench coat from the army surplus store this way. It complimented my goth/punk/weirdo look, but became rather unpopular with school admins after Columbine.Anyway, the usual $16 for the online course may not seem like a lot but for many people, it is. I get thank you emails from teenagers and college students and just regular adults who thank me, and I really cherish those emails.The internet makes sending out information so absurdly cheap. It took me a few months to make that course but once that's done, sending it out to literally hundreds of thousands of folks costs basically nothing. Now we as a society could use this amazing level of productivity to invest in our citizens and a social safety net so that we could become even wealthier and more productive, but instead we just give billions of dollars to assholes who switched from \"innovating\" to \"consolidating my monopoly\" the second they bought their Palo Alto mansion. I don't know what it is about my brain or upbringing or what, but I have a comfortable lifestyle and don't really feel the need to try to *maximize* wealth. No offense to people who like sports cars and staying at fancy hotels when they travel, but all that stuff strikes me as fucking stupid. As John Mulaney put it, \"Trump putting his name on buildings, like that's gonna keep him from dying.\"Anyway, that's why."

I have a text file of ideas somewhere.But I'd also like to create udemy courses and start making youtube videos again, and I have some software projects I'd like to do and I also want to contribute to Beeware."

So my old roommate was a high school science teacher, and she really drove home the point that teaching is something that I either couldn't do or would do badly. I get to write books and make online courses, and then I'm basically done. It's nice because it gets to reach a wide audience, *but there is no replacement for boots-on-the-ground teachers.*My \"students\" are self-selecting and I don't have to deal with classroom management or talking to parents or dealing with admins or fitting my curriculum to standardized testing nonsense, all while getting paid crap. You can't replace schools with random Udemy courses.I used to volunteer at [the MADE: The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment](https://themade.org/). It's a video game museum in Oakland, CA. They had a Saturday morning programming class in Scratch. It was only an hour and a half long, generally about 8 to 12 kids, and I'd often have one person helping me. IT. WAS. EXHAUSTING. I have no clue how teachers are able to handle 35+ kids for several hours a day, five days a week, and then do grading on top of that.Meanwhile, everyone thinks they know \"what schools should really teach is...\" like it's common sense. Or they spend a lot of time talking about how teachers unions are \"letting bad teachers stick around\" (certainly more time then they talk about how we can increase teacher salaries and divorce school funding from lottery revenue and property taxes, anyway.) The stats vary, but something like a third or half of teachers quit after just a few years, so if you've been teaching for just five years, you're basically a hardass veteran at that point. Between parents, politicians, school admins, and billionaire software monopolists with good PR, nobody is really standing up for teachers in the direct and material way that unions do. They have mad respect from me."

Amazon is an obvious example, but facebook does this too. People don't see it that way because facebook is free, but time is money as they say... and advertisers pay facebook for your time, so they make social media as addicting as possible in order to enrich themselves. The wealth allows them to buy out other social media companies or copy their innovations to maintain monopoly control. So facebook makes money by stealing time away from society (time that could have been gone towards being productive and creating value). Finance guys make fortunes off of other's people wealth (someone else had to lose the money). No one makes it into the 0.5% without stealing time and wealth from society. We need to stop idolizing these billionaires and corporations who are essentially crooks and have no interest in making society a better place for all of us. So THANK YOU for offering this service to us for FREE. If someone provides me with something I find valuable, I always like to send a tip to show support for their time and business (hope you take bitcoin). Not sure when I'll get around to doing the course though.. but I appreciate you for doing this!"

Nothing really clicked until I started reading your tutorials, and the way that it was structured, made it FUN. I got hooked.By the time I got to the web scraping tutorial, I had used what I learned to scrape the show note links from my favorite podcast (500 episodes, each with a dozen links, spread over each individual episode page) and organized it into a readable format to go through whenever I want. Then I got excited and started poking around elsewhere, like Flask. But I at least convinced my work to buy it as a reference book for other people in the company wishing to become more technically minded.Anyway, thanks for writing your tutorial and giving it away for free so someone like me, a man in his 30s with just an unused city planning degree, can pick up a whole new skillset (I've since moved from manual QA to site reliability engineering and have written production code to boot).

Some things were well over-explained whilst at other times I'd have to stop the video as you'd used a keyboard shortcut or something without explanation and I had to pause it just to keep up.  The final straw was after one particularly dry and boring (sorry again!) video you said something about the content in it was so important we should watch the video another two or three times...  No way...If I do continue it will be through the book rather than the videos.  I'm sorry if my feedback is insulting, to add something more constructive, for me I find studying anything is easier when there is a clear context for the information, or a clear problem that needs solving.  Many of the videos I did watch seemed to be introducing concepts but without any context of what they are used for/why they are important."

Even if I paid for 100% of the tuition out of pocket by working full-time, it was still at times REALLY challenging to complete my courses, online.   They had several areas of courses where concepts were broken down into small chunks, even within a chapter. I guess with technology attention spans are getting reduced to the next notification, and I don't know much about psychology by I've noticed this as I have grown up with no phones, little tech, then in the flip-phone days and then slowly adopted smartphones/computers/tablets.Another thing I would add is quizzes, but more often. Like a 10 question quiz after 2 or 3 of your 7 minute videos.  Even though it seems repetitive, having repetition in the quizzes causes the brain to take notice and solidifies the concepts better. My math professor used to say \"Repetition is the heart of confidence\" and he was absolutely right about that, especially when it comes to mathematics.If you have more questions about engagement and completion of courses, u/AlSweigart, please feel free to PM and I'm happy to share my experiences/feedback. With that being said I still struggle with course completion as well but that's a work in progress."

I didn't know programming, but I was pretty good at Excel (which probably means I wasn't). I have used your course as a spring board to make efficient programs for work. I think the key is to get someone to build a cool project as quickly as possible, which will drive their enthusiasm to want to continue.E.g, start with a prebuilt script and show them simply how to edit some variables to make it do what they want (a game, or to create many .xlsx files, or to sort a csv with pandas). By getting them to the 'a-ha' moment earlier, you will get them addicted.Thanks for your book."

For example, finish the course, 100% complete by x date (not too long) and y number of people chosen at random will win a voucher for the AWS exam.  The contest creates urgency to finish the course by a specific date.This makes the course very popular on Udemy because a lot of people sign-up.  In addition if the course is good, the students provide a lot of positive reviews.  Again, this makes the course more popular on Udemy. Then when the people pass the exam and say they took the course, that generates paying customers.From a psychological point of view, one of my degrees is in psychology, this makes sense.Do you have a email list I can sign-up for to be notified of the next free promotion?Best of luck!"

I could come up with a metaphor that allowed me to think about the operation as a mechanical or physical operation as opposed to computer voodoo. When I couldn't understand a topic I would try to make comparison to something physical and the points where I couldn't were the parts of that operation I wasn't understanding.

I needed the health insurance so I refused a buyout and insisted I could learn everything needed to become an entry level software engineer in six months. So my old co-worker, running a team now, took me on 'provisionally' and gave me the opportunities to learn everything, and at the end of the six months, i was 'cleared' to stay with the company as an engineer. I've not stopped learning ever since. I'm far from being able to do a ton of stuff, but I learn as I go, and I've written a few small tools that increase the team's productivity, rewrote an abandoned dashboard from scratch (Django app that monitors our ticket boards), released two personal projects (both flask apps) for fun, and am currently messing around with building probes for work."

                "comment": "A similar thing happened to me too. Seven month ago I took this front office job in which we had to wait for the first 2 months for the project to come in the country. Instead of spending those 2 months slacking off, because we literally had nothing to do, I started watching python tutorials. Fast forward 2 months, the project came. I quickly noticed the fact that in order to handle most of the tasks we had to cross check with a lot of excels with a lot of sheets. I used tkinter and openpyxl to create just one graphical interface for all the files. I have also used pyautogui to make some tasks handle themselves. Fast forward one month, I am in the books for a promotion for Service Matter Expert on automation amd I've been given automation related tasks. This happened only because I decided solve problems in a different way than the rest, even when no one asked me to. And just as a note, I graduated with a degree in Advertising, no connection to the IT field, no previous experience. My current job is filled with 70% to 80% people that either graduated or are in the course of studying computer science. The rest of 30 to 20% of people is composed by people that actually speak the language  that we work in, since it is not our native language or English. I had neither of those, only motivation to work and learn. Don't let yourself get scared by your lack of background or the level of the people that you are amongst. Enough hard work, curiosity and willingness to learn will get you far."

If something is estimated to be 3 weeks deadline, if you know you can do it in 1 day, don’t turn it in that fast.  The bottom line is that if you turn in work 20x faster than expected, they won’t suddenly pay you 20x more.  They’ll identify you as a person with a character flaw who will overly sacrifice themself to win the approval of everyone else and they’ll pivot to begin abusing that as much as possible.  Knowing this as fact, you gain a lot by really thinking a project through, making it as ideal as possible, taking company time to hone and learn all methods necessary for the project, no rush, be happy to know you’re well within deadline and keep that information to yourself."

There's a skill to seeing where the natural breaks are in a project which enable you to slice it into manageable modules. For your new role, if your company has moved into using Office365, look at PowerApps, PowerAutomate and SharePoint (maybe Power BI too). These provide pre-built modules you can stick together to automate things. It is advertised as low code/no code, but that isn't really true because you always end up having to write something to solve your problem. The syntax is a bit ugly, it's like if Excel and Python had a shameful one night stand, but at the end of the day, you can create attractive looking apps very quickly and give access to anyone else in your company. You'll certainly lean on the logic you've built up from learning Python. All in all, it's an easy string to add to your bow and can sometimes be simpler to implement than Python.Perhaps it's different in your organisation, but generally the SME stands for \"Subject Matter Expert\". That might help you avoid a boneappletea moment. Anyway, best wishes for your promotion and new role, it should be a blast.edit:I should probably say that I'd see the Microsoft automation stuff as automating processes, rather than tasks. By that I mean it's good for getting someone to do something, passing it on to the next person to do something or approve it and so on, while triggering off emails and other events as necessary. Perhaps \"Orchestration\" might be a better term than Automation. Python scripting may well be essential to actually assist with the processing of some of those tasks."

They will suddenly adopt the \"crabs in the bucket\" mentality and work towards sabotaging you at every opportunity in order to prevent themselves from looking stupid or useless compared to you. It's best not to share too much info on how you accomplish data driven tasks and never share your source code with anyone if you can avoid it."

That way you are still doing yourself and the company a service but you're also not setting expectations so high that they're going to burn you out giving you impossible deadlines in the future.I did this recently with some VBA automation at work. I initially said I thought it would take me about three days to get done, but I misjudged the difficulty and it only took me a day. I spent the next two days still working on VBA code and was able to further improve the automation and strengthen my VBA knowledge. My boss was happy I got it done in time, I was happy and not stressed, and now my VBA is that much better for next time I need to automate more reports."

Like you I started my Job off with some really quick impressive acomplishments, fortunately I realized after a bit people started acting like it was business as usual even though I was busting my ass. I didn't grind to a halt, but I did set reasonable deadlines. One trap that starts to happen is your higher ups start asking \"oh you can totally get this done by x\" and you being a hardworking person want to scream back \"of course!\" Trust me take a brief pause and think about it. Even if you say you'll need longer you'll either make that deadline or beat it both of which will make the team happy. The flip side is getting into the habit of being a \"yes man\" and then you either make the tight deadline and its business as usual or you don't make it and now you look bad. Also if your ahead of schedule by a lot don't be afriad to take some serious time to go back over your work. Early on the amount of times the second I thought I was done I went running to my boss saying I was it was finished only to realize later that multiple improvments could and should be made. TLDR don't be afraid to give yourself breathing room. Its better to over deliver than promise something you might not be able to pull off."

I guess my advice would be generalized for people starting out in software engineering - no matter where you work, keep learning, don't be afraid if you're unfamiliar with some technology, and just do what you can to learn it. I still run into a lot of popular technologies, for example splunk is something I managed to avoid for a while, and it just means spending some time researching best practices and figuring out how to use the clients. What I see in a lot of beginners is a lack of confidence, they see other people that just seem to know so much about something and act really confident, but it's really just time spent figuring it out and starting out having no idea how something might work or how to use it. A lot of confidence you see in the senior engineers is learned, and a lot of it is sometimes misplaced. They don't always make the best design decisions or write the best code. No one does, no matter how confident they sound about it. It's just hard to tell when you're starting out, and everyone just seems \"so much better\". It's all learned over time, and everyone starts out feeling overwhelmed, like they don't belong with all the \"experts\" around them. I see this a ton with people who are just starting to learn programming and get this immediate impostor syndrome when they're around people that just seem so much better than them.But advice regarding python specifically - learn the Python standard library. There is a LOT of good stuff in there, and I've run into so many engineers who have years of experience but haven't seen a couple things that Python offers by default.For example:- collections: defaultdict, Counter, deque, namedtuple (and a class inheriting from namedtuple can help make your class have a much smaller memory footprint, like `__slots__`, where it doesn't have a dict)- itertools: combination/permutation and more- contextlib: contextmanager, the decorator that turns a function with yield into a context manager (the `with` stuff)- struct: pack/unpack, when you need these, you NEED these.- bisect- calendar, has some useful datetime stuff that you might've thought you need a third party lib for, like iterating through days in a month/year- statistics, for median and stdev, which i used to do manually- tempfile, to get a temporary directory or file, super useful for just writing something out or even getting a new filename that's unique.- secrets, for generating cryptographically strong random numbers- ipaddress, for stuff like iterating over the IP addresses in a network- cmd, for making shellsAnd I'm sure there's more I haven't seen... but I don't think people realize just how many tools python provides by default."

And then I have a bunch of generic scripts that handle tasks that we get pretty often: adding mass amounts of people to AD groups, mass creation of AD groups, creation of service accounts, running reports for various lists, etc.   Powershell is great for anything active directory related."

Some basic ML is also good - mostly classification problems will get you going for a while. Last important thing - practice, practice, practice and don't forget about practice.

Articles from Medium - altough you have a limited access without  fee.YT Channels for Data Science in general i find Python Programmer really cool - https://www.youtube.com/user/consumerchampion - The man behind the channel lanuched a Udemy course on Python wcich Iam currently working on - It is very pleasant and detailed.Also this video is fun - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&t=302s - it is a real life application of the toolsetThe books: https://wesmckinney.com/pages/book.html - Written by the creator of Pandas himself - great resourceAutomate The Boring Stuff - mentioned many times but I like to come back to it from time to timePython Crash Course, 2nd Edition  - Many people  recommended this one, got it on my shelf but  didn't dive into it yet.Thats a few examples from memory. The way that works for me is I just start to watch some random DS/Python videos on YT and then dive into the abyss of yt algorithm - you can find many fun tutorials, archived livestreams etc. If you have any questions feel free to ask ;)"

However, classes are an exception and are the only place where you should be using CamelCase. The rest of your code should be following snake\\_case.If you aren't aware of it, Python has it's own style-guide (an exhaustive one) to write clean & concise code that is readable for everyone, from beginners to experts. You don't need to memorize it. Text editors & IDEs will point out most of your mistakes to you. But ensure that you follow the guide with as few compromises as you can.

I've been learning Python for about 1month now, and this course is by far the best resource I'm come across so far!  I've already gotten to the point where I am able to write Python scripts for automating a few things in my job.It teaches at a reasonable pace - nothing is dragged out.  You learn important concepts that often catch beginners out (speaking from experience!).  The content is presented in a fun and upbeat manner, and each lesson has a re-cap of everything covered at the end of the videos.I'm still very much a beginner, but this course has been superb for learning the basics and foundational Python skills you'll be using all throughout your coding journey!If you want to nail the basics of Python, and you want to hear the word 'spam' over and over again, then this course is perfect for you! 😁Edit: typo"

So far, if I had to put a number to it, I'd say around 30hours of actual time spent learning, then around another 30hours putting together projects and scripts for automation.  If you are full on with school, then do just 1 lesson of the Automate The Boring Stuff with Python a day.  The lessons are very short (especially the first lessons) and you'll begin to pick up the basics pretty quickly!  Then, when school isn't as hectic, see if you can put together some projects from the small lessons that you managed to do!"

The word comparison operation has no meaning to her and might as well have been written in greek or chinese or russian.What you did here was effectively translating the words you use into something that she could actually understand.There should honestly be a collection of concepts described in various different ways for people to read through and find what makes it understandable to them. This isn't limited to programming either, it could be maths, physics, economy, pretty much every subject could stand to gain from something like that.You say there are lots of people wanting programming explained in this way and I can assure you that there are plenty of people who want programming explained in a multitude of other ways as well."

Most of the actions are actually independent, so we get a heightened feeling that the action is happening all at the same time without really changing how the battle plays out.  But sometimes, if a targeted creature dies or moves out of range, you end up having to burn your planned action for movement ~~and reenter the task queue without having done any meaningful work~~.  And then, at the next round of combat, ~~all threads rejoin the thread pool and are assigned new work~~ we do it again.Eventually combat is resolved, initiative tracking is suspended, and the coordinating ~~thread~~ DM regains control of the ~~program~~ plot."

                "comment": "So when it comes to \"threading\" there's sort of two concepts that are a bit different, and I know they have different names but I think I've heard both used (improperly) interchangeably. So my vocabulary is gonna be wrong, I think, but I think my understanding of the concepts themselves are correct and distinct. Here goes:There's a technical distinction between \"multi-threading\" and _parallel processing_. While the colloquial meaning of \"multi-threading\" is \"parallelism\" they have some differences.Parallelism is several tasks that actually do things at the same exact time. More than one thing is truly happening at once.Multi-threading is where multiple things need to happen, but _only exactly one can happen at a time_. Depending on specifics, threads will either run until some magic (a timer interrupt) happens and they are forced to stop running, or they will voluntarily stop running and pass back and forth so none of them are left in the dust, but they aren't doing things _truly_ simultaneously. To examine the difference between \"at the same exact time\" and \"in sequence\" let's go back into the RPG for tangible examples.Consider a fighter and ranger in combat versus an orc in a hallway. The initiative order is (for whatever reason) Fighter, Ranger, Orc.The fighter goes down the hallway and hits the orc. Then, the ranger (who was out of range) advances forward _into the space the fighter just occupied_ and shoots at the orc. It is weakened, but it hits the fighter on it's turn.Nominally, these actions occurred \"at the same time\" (within the same round of combat) but they _actually_ happened one after the other.To see what I mean, let's consider some alternative cases:The initiative order is Fighter, Ranger, Orc. The same thing happens as above, except as the ranger takes the shot, he gets a critical hit, killing the Orc.In this scenario, the fighter does not take damage, as the Orc is not alive to deal the damage. (If things happened truly in parallel, the orc could have taken a swing while the ranger was repositioning or while his arrow was in flight, before death.)Consider another case: the initiative order is Ranger, Fighter, Orc:In this scenario, the ranger cannot move into the fighter's space and can't get a good shot. Or something - I've made the example a bit contrived, but I think the problem might be clear - the ranger can't move into the fighter's space until the fighter vacates it. (If the scenario was happening in _parallel_ the Fighter, Ranger, and Orc would all be moving and none of these issues would happen.)All of the things that happen in sequence here are almost examples of _pre-emptive thread scheduling_ (this is one of the options I mentioned above while referring to \"specifics\" in the fourth paragraph) which is that \"a thread (character) runs until it runs out of time allotment\" which is \"6 seconds\" to use the 4E time frames. Additionally, in these scenarios, only one character can run at once. In the scenario that /u/PurelyApplied described, the actions are resolved simultaneously, and thus is somewhat closer to true parallelism.Unless you're wanting to know about Semaphores and Mutexes and things like that, which is a whole different topic..."

I was very confused. One day I decompiled Minecraft and started playing with changing statements here and there to see what happened, and it quickly just clicked. From then on I kept on applying class concepts to Minecraft and it made perfect sense.I legitimately believe there could be some amazing things done by integrating Minecraft coding into the classroom. The codebase is huge, so you could find just about any type of programming concept you want to demonstrate. It's easy to fire up the game and see how things work, to really see the effects of your code. It would be easy to make assignments saying \"Make a new class which extends the existing Zombie enemy, but this zombie will leave behind a trail of fire everywhere it walks\".There would also be a lot of benefits in just seeing how real code looks and what professional programmers tend to have in their code. It would also give people firsthand experience in seeing what comments are useful and what are not, and when it might be nice to have more."

I used to teach intro to linux classes and often people would look at permissions like they were hieroglyphs, and they were certain that they would never understand them.

It seemed to me that her preconceptions about \"programming\" is, is what was holding her back.  She believed that programming was hard and that she couldn't do it.  She couldn't relate the jargon of programming to something she already knew.  So once she was shown the relationship between the jargon and what she already knew, that broke through her preconceptions and kinda \"pulled back the veil.\"People have all kinds of hangups about learning.

I remember back when I took chemistry and we went through the concept of Molarity about two thirds of the class got it but one third didn't. Our teacher then essentially described it the same way over and over again but that didn't help. After a while we as a class got together and we all tried different explanations to help them understand the concept. The interesting part was that many of those who didn't understand the concept were some of the best students in the class.Sometimes we just can't wrap our head around something and most of the time it's because of how it's explained, at least IME.I mean she obviously already knew the concepts but she just didn't know how to connect those concepts with the words the teacher used."

I was trying to illustrate the concept of testing a condition for determining weather the while loop would execute or not. Conceptually, there's not difference between the two, but 'while Target\\_enemy == True:' is a bit easier to visually dissect, I think.     One of the other exercises I use in my tutoring appointments is I will take out a segment of code from a more developed program I have, and ask the student to read through the code and explain back what they think it means. Generally students get 70-80% of it just by parsing their way through the code and actually processing what they are reading. I do this to try and break them out of the mindset of worrying about syntax and coding form and focus more on the content of the code.  They can learn syntax and form later. Here they're trying to learn the broad concepts."

When you have a class of 20-40 students, and a total of 64 hours to conduct the class, a teacher simply can't work at hammering out 10 different metaphors and explanations for all of their students to get every concept. But as a Tutor, working with 1 or 2 students at a time it's much more viable to accomplish this."

But then they look at something like:    e=l.readlinesand they try to figure out what word is 'l.readlines' and treat it as some sort of foreign language.One of the tricks I've used in several of my appointments is I'll pull up a chuck of code from another program, give them no context of what the program is or what it does, tell them to read the code and puzzle through it, and when they think they understand what the code says, explain it back to me. Today I used this chuck:    with open(fname) as file_src:        for line in file_src.readlines():            clean_line = line.rstrip('\\\\n:,.')            file_cs = clean_line            counter += 1            word = file_scs.split()            number_of_words = len(word)She actually got about 95% of it right out of the gate. The only thing she didn't get was what len(word) meant, which is understandable since she hasn't learned about lists yet. But typically this is a good confidence boost for the students as it seems like I'm dropping this huge complex program in front of them and they're able to figure out a lot of it right off the bat."

Not a \"Intro to Python\" or \"Intro to Java\" but an \"Intro to Programming\". Using Roll Play game mechanics as the object examples. Have an online section maybe with downloads of code specific versions of the explanations.Like in the book itself, the section that talks about Control statements would be something like:\"Dave is going to try and Bluff his way out of detention. So he takes his Charisma Stat, which is an 8, and adds the bonus from his 'Silver Tongue' skill which gives him a +2 to his Charisma stat when he's talking to someone else. In this case he's trying to bluff his way past Principle Jones. Since Jones is only concerned with whether or not Dave completed his assignment, he will use his Intelligence stat (Which is an 8) to determine if he can tell that Dave is lying.There are 4 possible outcomes from this roll:1- Dave rolls less then Jones' score, in which case Jones sends Dave to detention2- Dave and Jones get the same score, in which they must re-doll the rolls3- Dave rolls better then Jones, but less then 5 points better meaning Dave will avoid Detention.4- Dave's result is 10 points or more then Jones, in which case not only does Dave avoid Detention, but Jones gives him 5 bucks for his mistake.So you would have a series of tests:&#x200B;if Dave.roll < Jones.roll:\"Dave goes to detention\"if Dave.roll == Jones.roll:\"Re-do the roll\"if Dave.roll is more then jones.roll but less then jones.roll + 5:\"Dave avoids detention, today.\"if Dave.roll is equal to or greater then jones.roll+10:\"Dave avoids detention and Jones gives him $5 for the mistake.\"&#x200B;Have a brief explanation about that example is an if/else loop and what that may be called in different languages.&#x200B;and then:For the Python Version, go to this URLFor the Java Version, go to this URLfor the C++ version, go to this URLetc."

And then she went on learning more and more Python and data analysis/wrangling skills. And now she runs the data analytics department of her company and makes several times my lowly public university faculty salary doing so.

This slows you down so you can get an idea of how programming concepts come together to make a simple game or art program.Then, move on to another, and another, etc. When I first started programming, I mainly just copied existing programs, and made tiny changes to them to play around with how they work. It helped me go from just syntax to actually creating things.A lot of people say, \"Look at the code for open source projects\" but these are often poorly documented and huge. These programs have been designed to be short and simple (they only use text with print() and input()) so that you can actually understand them in a single sitting."

If you made a post on any sub about a dog licking it’s butt and it got a millions views and comment and upvotes they would leave it because it draws attention to their sub which no one was paying attention to any ways. I’ve seen this in one of those visual illusion subs where people might just post a pretty picture- nothing to do with illusions and the mods leave it only if it becomes popular. In short, they apply a double standard when posts are more popular than the sub. Mr. Al is great btw so in this case his work and stature raises the caliber of this sub. He should even make the the mods pay a fee for associating with him honestly since the sub is a barren wasteland without people like him."

Specially with violin plot. I googled them and search on YouTube but can't understand fully. Just to be clear , I am a CSE student , and never learnt any statistics in my life. Do you think the resources you provided for statistics will help me(who have basically zero knowledge in statistics) fully understand them?Do you have any additional suggestions for me?"

I’ve used it subsequently, but ran into problems with custom colour palettes that are a non-issue in MPL (it was possible but fiddly). [Edit—this was in Bokeh, not Plotly!]Charting in Python is very much not a solved problem in the same way that ggplot is for R. My favourite interface is Altair’s, and being JS-based it works very well online.

To store data that’s more structured than a CSV file can handle, for uploading to a database (because it’s quicker than creating a UI for uploading stuff). The uploading itself is handled in Python and the upload file will have a related Python class that reflects the structure of the workbook. The uploaded data is then input to the database tables proper by a stored procedure.2. Toy examples and sharing results with people who aren’t as technical.My first job, 14 years ago and before I did my PhD, was as a risk analyst for an energy company. There I learned VBA, writing wrappers around C++ code for Monte Carlo simulations (among other things), so I have quite a lot of experience with the limits you can take Excel to. One of the many problems with Excel for data analysis is that code reusability is very low—you can store code in your PERSONAL.xlsb file or include it in specific workbooks, but there’s no central store. In addition, version control is non-existent.In contrast, I have several libraries which I work with in Python that I constantly add to to make life easier, and these are stored in version control and all users can then update to the latest version to get new features. So when I fire up a new Jupyter notebook to do some exploratory data analysis, I import my standard libraries (with a keybinding, naturally) and get started doing interesting stuff very quickly.I really can’t imagine a use case where Excel would be superior to Python for any analysis. I will say that while VBA is massively inferior to Python, the lessons you can learn from doing it will be transferable, so it’s definitely worth keeping it up while at work. Just remember to use `Option Explicit`!"

For example, [this interactive Altair chart](https://datapane.com/reports/J35w1k0/) is like only about 10 lines of code, and looks and works great, and is interactive in the browser. You can also see that it's composable - so I can create a base from the data, and use that base to create both a line chart and a scatter plot, for instance. Bokeh is really powerful too, but I find it a little less elegant."

I’m on mobile. Anyhow, the ‘’ is an empty string. You just hit <enter> and that satisfies it. Hitting anything else will push to the else: Statement. dontSend() could include an object with each email you chose not to send appended to it, and after you finish running through the email send verification you can have the code go back to the ones you didn’t send for correction.You can also put in a separate object that tracks all sent emails and use it to verify ones that are about to be sent haven’t been already, to prevent duplicates. Lots of fun ideas, just keep optimizing the code and adding helpful features. Be sure to document your code with comments though, even if you’re the only person to use it. IT will thank you if it ever becomes a shadow system and they’re tasked with reverse engineering it, plus comments will save you time as the program becomes for advanced."

Perhaps they mean intuitive as some kind of dialog for the fact that Python is often used for AI? That wouldn’t make the *language* intuitive though, and arguably the program isn’t intuitive either. It’s just doing as it was programmed to. Maybe they mean intuitive by that you don’t have to specify a lot of things with Python, such as declaring an objects type before using it."

It is very satisfying to automate something that 'really should be done by a robot' for the first time.Just a quick warning from a veteran... You should maintain a healthy fear of your script. Use it enough and you will almost certainly botch an email campaign by sending dupes, sending to too wide a list, sending the wrong email, borking the template, whatever-- it happens to the best of us. Think about what can go wrong when you're broadcasting to an audience and you'll write safer tools."

Also, I don't think it gets much better than pip installing new packages and being able to use them immediately without having to think twice.Sorry to the \"c\" snobs out there, I'm sure I could have made the c++ more simple.

If you know how to code so that these don't bottleneck your program then you can still get close to C or Fortran speeds. These include:Avoid loops at all cost (stick to list comprehensions or functional functions -ie map, pop, and zip), avoid recursive function calls, stick to the standard library or libraries that are written in C. You can also add additional speed through precompilation at runtime using Numba decorators. And then there are some optimizations that can be made via program structure/syntax. IE using numpy over math, multiple assignments, etc. Speed in python is a hat full of tricks whereas speed in C is more built-in. It can be achieved in either with enough care. However, poorly written C or cpp can equally be slow if you're that bad at programming."

It’s at best a middle of the pack choice for web dev -> I think TS+Node, C#.NET are both better than Django or Flask at scalability, ecosystem, speed, and ease of deployment. They’re different languages for different purposes. If you want something fast, i.e. me right now, writing 3d modeling software, then C/C++ or Rust is the way to go. If you want something that compiles fast and has low level performance, use Go. This isn’t a knock on Python. I love using it for data analysis and prototyping things quickly, but it is in *no way* an improvement on C. They’re not even in the same category of use case."

Anyone have thoughts on the MIT course vs this one: https://www.edx.org/course/python-basics-for-data-scienceI'm interested in automating the retrival of some data points from financial statements/bloomberg and working up some ratios and reports, so figure the data science oriented course is probably better for me?  Think its worth revisiting the MIT one once done auditing the IBM course or is there something else I should look to instead like: automate the boring stuff? Or just go down that data science pathway with IBM on edx?"

I don't recommend paying for it if you're just getting started, and the fact that your access ends a week after the last class is aired means little to no time to catch up if you get stuck.That being said, I highly recommend it-Dr Grimson is an amazing teacher, and it'll really help you once you have an idea of concepts like loops and writing dry code.

They are both very accessible and free to audit so you’ve got nothing to lose but time and your mind. Neither one is going to teach you how to write the exact program you intend to write, however, they will both enable you to work it out on your own. Programming is actually a state of mind, once it clicks anything is possible."

I still say it's worth it, but the absolutely best part for me was his coverage of algorithms. Someone else on here might have a suggestion for something else for algorithms"

The way LPtHW teaches you is kind of a “f-you figure it out” approach. This isn’t for everyone, but I think it helped me become a better programmer. It introduces you to a concept and if you want/need to find out more it tells you to look at the documentation or google the question. This teaches you what actual working devs do every day. I can’t specifically recommend it to you though, because I don’t know you and I don’t know what you will know at the end of ATBS."

The main categories you would want to look into and choose your favorite are: Scripting/automation, data science/AI, Web Development, mobile development, and desktop development. Research all of these, and give them all a shot. Continue to mess with them until you find one that stands out. Get really good with libraries related to that, and practice creating full projects in your category. If you want to become a software engineer, try getting familiar with all of them, but I would focus on things like data and scripting. Good luck!"

So I resorted to the python docs, looking at all the basic functions and mastering every one. It took a while, but I would write a program that includes and revolves around that new thing I learned. Whenever I didn’t know of a function existed, I would just look it up on google. Typically W3Schools or something would have it. Whenever I learned a new function, I would put that code on a replit at repl.it. I would also put how to use it exactly in comments(#[your text]). So whenever I got lost, I could scroll through my replits and find one I was looking for. I then could look at how you use it, and then I would include it in my program. This eventually led me to remember every single one."

This is where it took me so long when starting to learn programming.  I focused on the big picture. Rather than just a small component of it. Once you do the small pieces so many times, it will become second nature. You will not have to think about it really that much. It's not that you will not think about it so often, it's just that you will be familiar with design of the code or understand in a precise manner how to word your question? If that makes any sense."

I always thought people learned different ways like having a teacher, online courses, listening, writing stuff down, but never thought about how people learn in terms of that. For classes, here’s my tip:For self, think of it as a universal variable for your class(Might make it harder to understand, but a variable for your class specific to the object your using it with). So it’s kind of like a messenger. It delivers variables from that object to your functions. It also delivers functions to other parts of your class, etc. For __init__(), it’s what you use to create that object. It’s the initializer. Also for passing something into a class like GridLayout or App(talking about that tutorial), don’t worry about that. In base python, you don’t really use that. In fact, I don’t pass on things to a class very often at all besides Kivy and stuff."

Saving is essentially: \"what I've written is what I intended\".Then you'll run or test your code, and discover that while you wrote what you intended, it's not what you *meant*, so you'll make some more changes, save, and repeat. At some point what you've written will work the way you want. A commit is essentially: \"what I've written is what I need\".Then you'll combine a bunch of \"what I need\"s into a working feature, repeating all the above. This is when I push--probably not to `main`, but to the dev or working branch. A push is \"this is complete\".Remember that commits are free, easy, and can be infinitely modified especially when local. You can take a bunch of commits and merge them into one, you can split a commit into multiples, you can reorder them, change them, add to them, etc. Too many people treat commits like they're carving stone.----My workflow looks something like:* Identify a feature to work on* Make a dev branch for that feature* Write some code, save, repeat* When things work (but might not be complete) commit, even if it's \"WIP\"* When I get up from the desk, commit* When I'm leaving for the day, commit* When I have to switch to another task, commit* When the feature is working, then I squish all my intermediate commits into one, logical \"component\" with more descriptive commit messages and push.* A feature usually consists of multiple, squashed \"component\" commits* Then the dev branch is merged with a pull requestCommit messages are a very powerful tool to remind yourself of what you were doing, so use them. Even if I haven't touched a particular branch or code in a while, I can jump back in by reading my commit messages."

I've often pushed at the end of the day whether the code works or not if I'm the only person working on the code base for two reasons:1. Use the remote repository as a backup2. I may want to work from home later in the night or tomorrow on another computerI **commit** after every discrete complete change.  That is, when I can write a commit message like \"finished the #123 bug changes\".  You shouldn't have multiple changes in a file made for unconnected reasons.I never comment code out because \"I might need it\".  There are two reasons why you might need it.  First, you are uncertain that the changes you have made are something you should do, ie, they are experimental.  In that situation you may want to go back to the earlier version, or two.  For a single file you can just go back one or two commits.  For larger, longer timeframe changes, I try to remember to tag before starting the series of changes so I can easily revert multiple files back to a known point.  For smaller code bases I have been known to nuke or rename the directory and reclone from the remote repository as a last resort.  Really only possible if you know you started from a clean state with no pending pushes.Second, if you think you might use that commented out code in other files or projects then it's worth taking that code out and making a proper mini-project of it with documentation, examples and a test-suite, all in a git repository somewhere.  Much easier for you and others to reuse that way.That's what I do, but YMMV."

Now, instead of digging through 10x your codebase's worth of comments, you just search the commit history for that useful message you left at the time.8. Checkout that commit, and your file (the whole repo, really) will be returned to the exact state it was in when you made it.9. Copy whatever you needed from it.10. Go back to the last commit again, restoring all your subsequent changes.11. Now you've got all your shiny new code, plus that dusty old function you thought you'd never need again, without having to lug it around in a comment the whole time.There's a lot more to it ultimately, like branching and merging parallel commit histories, undoing or patching individual commits onto others, etc. that gives you a lot more flexibility, but that's all you really need to get started down the road out of overly-commented hell."

Even if they don’t, it may be a bonus on a future job if you ever end up switching companies.It is definitely worth learning it for yourself too. It is an extremely useful tool that lets you dev faster, even in personal projects. Learn git flow. There’s apps and sites that actually simulate a git repo to learn the commands and common practices. The whole idea is to keep separate dev and production branches and develop new features in feature branches. This way if a feature breaks the app, only that one feature branch is broken and you can easily roll back by checking out the develop branch again. Meanwhile, your production code is untouched on the production branch, waiting for finished features to be merged in.

There IS such a thing as writing too many tests, and being careful not to can lead to tests that are easier to maintain over time.He even covers some integration and end to end testing practices, so the book covers the three major phases of testing."

If methods are simple and complementary, I'll often commit them together. If they are more complex, I will see what can be abstracted, commit the abstracted function, and then commit when I write the method that uses them.Depends on your definition of feature/subfeature.... I don't mean \"commit entire user stories at once.\" A single method or function can be a \"feature.\" I use the [angular commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit). In that sense, `git commit -m 'feat: implement method foo'` is much more logical than `git commit -m 'it's a bunch of shit but I didn't commit in 2 hours so here goes nothing'`.The important thing to me is:- commits should be a whole [whatever], as much as possible- commits should not break existing code (I sometimes do commit broken code to some branch so I can resume somewhere else, but avoid it as much as possibe)."

Git has become the defacto standard because it's more powerful than the previous generation of tools.I'm not sure what you mean by \"the commands don't make sense.\" The basics are:git clone <repo>: copy a repository to your local computergit pull: get the most recent changes from the remote repogit add <directory | files>: add or stage these files for the next commitgit commit -m \"commit message\": commit the staged files with the provided messagegit push: sync my local commits with the remote repogit branch: see what branch I'm ongit checkout <branch>: switch to another branchgit checkout -b <branch>: start a new branch from where I'm currently atThose commands are enough for most developers starting out. The Git Book does a great job explaining in more detail what these and other commands actually do.Merging can be seen as a difficult or complex thing, but that's not because of how git handles conflicts. Merging conflicting files is just a complex thing in general. This is part of why continuous integration is so popular: it's easier to manage continuously integrating and resolving conflicts throughout the day than it is to wait until a bunch of features are done and then try to merge them all into the main branch in one go. From the perspective of git though, merging is quite simple: git will tell you what files conflict and show you the two conflicting changes. You can then choose one (or even write new code to replace them) and commit your choice. Many editor plugins and external tools have features to help with this.Rebasing can be a little trickier, but if done right can keep the commit history nice and linear. To me, this is an example of a feature that could be considered complex, but also isn't necessary. It's something that's done a lot in continuous integration scenarios where everyone commits to the same \"trunk\" branch and the goal is to have a completely linear timeline of code changes.In my experience, the most difficult part of git to understand is how to change things that have already been committed in a dirty way (i.e. not adding a \"revert\" commit, but actually changing history). These kinds of operations should rarely if ever be done, so 99% of your workflow shouldn't involve them. The only reason I can think of off the top of my head is if someone accidentally committed a secret like the database password or a private key or something along those lines. Even then, you need to change the password/key out and assume it's compromised. But you could also go back and erase that part of the commit if you're well versed in git. Outside of edge cases like that, I don't find git to be too complicated once you get some experience."

                "comment": "People squash to keep large projects manageable. When working on a complex feature, a developer might make several commits during the process, treating the commits like checkpoints that they could easily go back to. So locally a developer may have a series of commits like:- OAutb for Google working- WIP GitHub OAuth- GitHub OAuth working- Clean up OAuth code- Add AuthStrategy classThis is good locally because the dev can revert small chunks of code and easily see what all they've done. But at the end of the day this is all for one feature, so in the grand scheme of things it is better if it's all one commit. To achieve this, the developer squashes all those commits into something like \"OAuth support\" before pushing. As the commit history for large projects grows, this kind of cleanliness is actually very useful as you can see a definite timeline of features that have been added and bugs that have been resolved, rather than just seeing a timeline of all the small things developers did/undid.This strategy is especially helpful for projects using true continuous integration practices and commiting to a single \"trunk\" branch instead of creating tons of feature branches. In this environment, your commits need to be cohesive and nothing can ever be committed that isn't fully functional (since the CI/CD pipeline would reject it if tests fail). Combining all this results in a very robust feedback loop since when the CI/CD pipeline fails, the team can look at these \"full\" commits for problems, rather than having to look at several small \"in progress\" commits, some of which undo previous commits.Until you've had to track down sneaky bugs with the help of git diffs this may not seem super important, but it is actually a tremendous help.Another slightly related subject is formatting. One of the most annoying things I've run into with a large project is multiple developers who have different formatting styles on their editors such that a file where they edited 2 lines shows up in git diff as the entire file being changed because of indentstion differences, etc. When I first started programming, explicit styling seemed OCD and pointless to me (as long as the code was readable). But once you get into a large project, you need to make sure that git only tracks actual code changes and not styling changes in order to be able to use git diffs effectively."

If it's someone else's repository you can start a local branch to commit to locally so that you can switch branches as you need. If you end up adding some functionality that's cool, you can tell the owner and they can decide if they want to merge that branch or not.The main utility of a branch (afaik) is that you have to commit changes before you can switch versions (checkout another branch), so a branch is like a bookmark of your different versions.Everything gets a lot clearer as you learn the structure of the program."

You don't get any history from multiple adds - it is the commits that give you history.I usually rely on `git commit -a -m \"<commit message>\"` where the `-a` means add any \"tracked\" files that are modified. So basically commit and add in one go. A tracked file is one git knows about. This means that it has previously been added (including before an earlier commit) so an explicit add command (`git add <file>`) is only really needed for new files. What I tend to do, when I am ready to commit, is to do `git status`. This shows me a list of all modified tracked files and a list of untracked files. The untracked files can be a mixture of files that I don't want to add to the git repo at all, and new files that need adding. At this point I will add the new files, before doing the commit command I mentioned above.Sometimes I will instead add a new file just after creating it or after I have finished working on its initial version but I don't particularly distinguish between doing this and adding just before committing as I just described.The process I outlined there is a good argument for maintaining a clean working tree - i.e., one in which there are very few untracked files other than ones you intend to add. This can be achieved by a combination of simply removing files that don't need to be there any more, and making use of the `.gitignore` file to tell git what files to ignore when looking for untracked files. Keeping things clean in this way makes it less likely to miss a new file in the untracked list."

If something broke somewhere, you can `git bisect` and find your mistake (\"it worked _yesterday_! WTF!?). You can go back and grab code out of it if you decided it was useful but has since then be removed. But in the _long term_ it's _not_ important, so that's why I would just squash it at the end.You can even clone it in another place on your file system if you wanted."

That said, *preparing* for it is a good move; building credit can take years, starting as soon as possible is usually really a good ideaAs for the opportunity cost, in many places, rent and mortgage payments are very similar. In that situation, there isn't nearly as much opportunity cost.This does, of course, assume single income, single person renting. With roommates, there's a lot more financial opportunity it would seem.Anyway, generally I'd suggest looking into buying, at least - not just assuming it's for much later in life."

How did you study for those? I'm still having a hard time because I tend to study it like a text book (Go through each page of an algorithm book and read and do the quizzes). Perhaps your approach is different, and maybe more efficient than mine, I'd like to know.* Did you do some code contests/quizzes (Hackerrank, Codewars, etc.) or were you mainly focused on developing stuff and applying your knowledge there?* I really don't have much of a math background besides some college level statistics, and I'd like to know if the maths are integral to becoming a Data Engineer or at least on the position that you landed."

Specifically, relational databases.Python is a general purpose language and can do significantly more than SQL.How they complement each other is that Python can send SQL code (queries) to a database and in our current age of data, automating a lot of work and being more time efficient is highly valued.  How this fits into a hypothetical example is let's say you have a new table every week with a billion rows and you want to analyse every week and turn the results into a graph.  You would have to get into the office, execute the query, wait for it to work, then convert it into a graph.  With Python, you could schedule to run your SQL query in the middle of the night, process the data, check the data's right, and even make the graph so when the analysts clock in for work, they get can get on with analysing the data instead of waiting around.Of course, this really is a very high level, low detail example.

I'm still having a hard time because I tend to study it like a text book (Go through each page of an algorithm book and read and do the quizzes). Perhaps your approach is different, and maybe more efficient than mine, I'd like to know.Not the best answer from me, although a lot of my career is understanding stuff in steps and then deciding where something isn't working.  Same with programming.  My personal process for understanding how stuff works usually involves going back one step to get a deeper understanding or breaking it down into parts rather than saying A to B.> Did you do some code contests/quizzes (Hackerrank, Codewars, etc.) or were you mainly focused on developing stuff and applying your knowledge there?I've definitely done some of those early on (around the 2 month mark) just because it's always recommended by everybody in the subreddit.  I spent way more time building my own projects and trying to commercialise skills via freelancing because I felt it was more relevant.  A high score in codewars is great although you miss out a lot of important skills such as client interaction, time management, project management, and negotiation which you get from chasing paid work.> I really don't have much of a math background besides some college level statistics, and I'd like to know if the maths are integral to becoming a Data Engineer or at least on the position that you landed.I can't answer this yet as I'm not a DE although I can say it's definitely going to be important.

How important would you consider a degree?Tying in with the top point, degrees and experience are as relative as you can make them and that's a big part of job hunting - being able to tell your potential employer you have demonstrable transferrable skills. A degree is important for a number of things.  It tells an employer you can actually see something through.  A lot of people complete degrees and it's not a special thing, although starting one and then dropping out would be something that would make an employer ask why.  Additionally, it adds social value as it's a shared, common experience that people can relate to, compare, and contrast their own experiences with.That being said, would I say you need one? Hard to say as I technically haven't entered the field yet.  I'm completely unaware of there being pay ceilings based on level of degree unlike Chemistry where I know not having a PhD these days often presents glass ceilings.  Personally, I think commercial experience and working within a company is more important as you learn things which will never got taught in university such as how to constructively argue, how a company works, and, most importantly, the concept of being valuable.  It's extremely easy to think that somebody is only as valuable as their technical skillset and title of their degree.  In reality, it's a very complicated concept and one that only makes a lot of sense when you see completely useless people earn an insane amount of money.  In my previous role as a scientist, I worked with somebody who's core value came from being bilingual in the language where a vast majority of our raw materials suppliers are based whilst completely lacking in Chemistry, technical approach, project management, and general competency.In short, the most important thing to a company is being able to demonstrate you have valuable skills.  How you do that is through a previous history of being able to do stuff and/or examples of being able to do stuff.  I say this because at one of my old companies, we hired some marketing person to \"supercharge the business\".  They ended up getting sacked because they were found out to be lying about all of their business credentials and passed out on site in the changing room, reeking of alcohol."

Also different data types although you'll probably be familiar with those.SQL is a really big part of DE too so if you haven't already definitely research relational databases, SQL vs NoSQL, and generally understand relational database design.> Do you also have tips maybe in term of soft skills and how I can explain the switch?If this is a field you're genuinely interested in (as opposed to wanting to cash in on the hype), it'll definitely show in the interviews.

I understand the very basics of ML (how to choose a model, train and test data sets, why you should cross validate, what stats to use, and basic identifiers for when a model might not be very good).  This has been helpful from a DE point of view as I can potentially forsee how the data I send across might fuck with the model.  As mentioned, I'm a little put off by ML after seeing it in industry.  In principle, ML is great and can do great things when used correctly.  In my previous experience, and possibly others, ML is massively hyped by middle managers with no technical knowledge and have politicised it to the point where it becomes a focus for their appraisal rather than a tool which can be used to improve a part of the business."

It jumps into using loads of built-in methods before even talking about variables... There are also a few exercises at the end of each sub-chapter. It doesn't seem like it would be enough for an introductory programmer -- maybe an enthusiastic one, but it's likely that this was meant for people with some good programming background.

Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met, never had no problem with, get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', \"Oh, send in the Marines to secure the area\" cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some kid from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass.And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And, of course, the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.And they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs, and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive, so he's got to walk to the fuckin' job interviews, which sucks cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin', cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat, the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.So what did I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure fuck it, while I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy, take his job, give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?

So FOUO was supposed to go away.Unfortunately [it didn't work](https://sgp.fas.org/othergov/intel/ratcliffe-cui.pdf). Bureaucrats will bureaucrat.>As currently conceived, instead of simplifying and replacing a handful of current markings with one new CUI marking, the CUI Program has expanded to over 124 categories in 20 groupings, with 60 Specified and 60+ Basic categories.

Regular people will see an issue, not see a solution and respond with \"welp, guess it's broken\". We're different though, we're programmers! \"Why is this broken?\" \"How does this work?\" \"Can I make this better?\" those are the hardest things to stick to your brain when starting out.Learning to program isn't so much as to just learn the language, it's to get into that mentality, breaking things down into their simplest steps, then going on-by-on into them, just like IKEA furniture instructions.Hell you can even apply that to anything in your life, car issues? Break it down! Painting a room? Break it down! Doing yard work? BREAK IT DOWN! Once you get down the mentality, you can learn any language. It's just a matter of knowing the syntax and the usability.Keep up the great work everyone, programming is really an art, grab the keyboard and **HAVE FUN!**"

If you're stuck, walk away and rest your mind, whether it's with a book, a game, music, or a nap. Many times, the answer will present itself to you after that moment away.Not grasping something? Look to see how someone else explains it.After you read it, do it. After you do it, teach it. That will cement your understanding and serves to not only self-identify your weaknesses but also gives you the best chance at mastering something.**BEST PROGRAMMER ADVICE**: rubber duck. Get one and put it on your desk. If you're stumped and know that something should work but it doesn't, walk the duck through the problem, what you've done, and why you believe it should work. Communicating the problem uses a different part of your brain and allows you to see parts of the problem you may not have been acutely aware of before. Sounds silly, sure, but there are mountains of successful devs and SEs that have had or still keep around a rubber duck."

My Union Hall has no hiring prospects for at least a month from now.  So I took the advice of a successful friend and started learning programming, despite not having even owned a computer in over 10 years.  The curve is steep, and not easy.  But you will not learn what you don't learn.  You have to force it down your throat until you get it.  And you will get it, even if it's not as fast as you thought.  Change takes effort.  Now I'm at the point that I can answer a lot of Beginner questions, when just a few months ago I didn't even know how to pip install or use f strings.  I still feel dumb, but that will never change.  As long as I can answer more questions every time I see them, I know my knowledge is increasing."

I don't work in IT (Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist) so my understanding of Python consists mostly of Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. My job heavily relies on SAS for crunching big numbers and Python is considered a niche skill, but I kept at it anyway since I find Python to be much more intuitive and straightforward than SAS (which feels like a fossil compared to Python). Most people around me told me to stop wasting time with a skill I will never use at work, but I kept at it cause I find it extremely fun messing around in Python.As luck would have it, my latest project requires heavy usage of Python as most of the data is in Thai and SAS Enterprise Guide apparently cannot deal with Thai. Since I'm the only guy on my team who knows Python at all, I've basically been given an unprecedented opportunity to flex my knowledge. Feels good to know that all the troubles that I went through over the past year paid off"

But are you going to be satisfied then?This doesn't want to be demotivational. It's ok to take chunks of code here and there, but first try to do it by yourself.

I learned the very very basics in Python, relearned them in swift, then spent weeks on my first project of my own (recreating a basic text interface app I made in Python with SwiftUI). Most of that time was trying to learn how to use binding states and persisting data. I’d also add to save all the resources and tutorials you use to learn. Never know when you might have found a gold nugget of code or approach to code that you will want to go back too. In all my struggles, following many random videos for how to make similar apps, I stumbled across a tiny snippet of code that was casually mentioned in one video. It eliminated the need for lines of code for clear buttons to clear a text entry field/form after you submit it with a button. Also, applicable to many forms of learning:Build a solid foundation of fundamentals. If you get stuck, and don’t know what to do, and realize you don’t even know what you don’t know, revisit the fundamentals—in excruciating detail. In swift, as an example, closures and nil coalescing can be horrible confusing to learn, but once they click your life gets much easier; they only click if you keep working to learn despite how hard it is."

I've found CodeWars to be really helpful in that regard by giving me little challenges to solve but it won't teach you to be a better programmer (that, I think, comes from the tenacity that started us down this path).Although, I'm still struggling mightily with figuring out Pycharm's virtual environments. What do you mean \"pandas does not exists\"?! I can see it in your little libraries folder, it's in the project's settings, I can run it from your the python terminal window in Pycharm...argh! Screw it! I've spent three hours trying to figure this out. Pandas, welcome to the main install.Tool woes aside, I  realized last night that I'm using the same solutions to a lot of problems: Counter variables, an empty dict to be populated, for loops, etc. My code, while functional, isn't pythonic. Time to set the next goal of writing *better* code: comprehensions, figuring out how to use enumerate(), lamdas, etc.Good luck folks, it isn't easy but you're also not alone in the struggle. :)"

When I took my community college classes in programming, I thought they were fun.  But as I progressed through the sequence, people dropped out after each course.  They were intelligent people, but their minds just didn't work like ours.I don't want to sound completely negative.  You can probably force yourself to learn if you try hard enough.  And probably get a job and make a decent living.  But it will just be a job, and you will live for the weekends like most people do.

I had trouble learning how to not get frustrated and how to consistently overcome seemingly insurmountable hurdles. However, at some point you just become used to it. Probably because I learned that the “breaking things down” process is literally either manually tracking your algorithms and code flow for bad code, or plugging compiler messages/your own questions into Google. (Same can be said for other life issues too 🤪). I do think that’s the best skill: to become someone who is not deterred by a problem that seems impossible anymore."

You can write reports, compose low-level stored procedures and functions, administrate data warehouses, and so on, by starting with basic knowledge of how relational databases operate and working your way up to related technologies. And if you can do that in conjunction with regular programming skills, you'll find lots of opportunities for work across different industries. Most of my work over 20 years has involved SQL Server and MS Access in various degrees, with a little Oracle and MySQL thrown in, and I'm always up for learning useful technologies new and old. It's been an interesting career for me so far, and I'm mostly self-taught."

So luck and network I guess but in Sweden and Europe it seem to be a push for rpa. I see lot of ads for it and we seem to hire new devs a couple times a year."

Not only that, you actively tell people that it will be free again at the start of next month if they miss the free period this time. Basically you do everything you can to NOT make money from a very popular course but rather ensure that people have the opportunity to join even if they're struggling money-wise.This way, you are the personification of the best part of the programming world - people sharing, not monetising, because learning and software should be free."

IMHO, if you can influence at least **one** new programmer with your material, then you have succeeded. Never know what advances and contributions could be made to this world as a result. Also: I think making the course free will certainly attract a nonzero number of people to sign up and complete it. It’s hard to go above and beyond that as far as incentives go. You’ve already exhausted extensive sharing options such as the website, free videos on YouTube, and now the free coupon codes for a limited time. Impressed by your and other programmers’ willingness and desire to share with others. It’s not intuitive in a fast paced world today where there are endless projects to undertake and endless hobbies to partake in personally and selfishly."

Once you've spent 3 hours writing it, you can turn around and write it in 10 minutes, too. :-)Figure programming is made up of two things:* Figuring out how to solve the problem* Actually making code that does it.Each time you spend 3h researching how to do something, that's 3h you won't need to spend the next time you want to do that same thing. And the more times you do the \"solve the problem\" part, the better you'll get at it.&#x200B;>Build your Github as soon as you canWorth noting that you don't need github to use git. \"git init\" in any directory and you can check your code in locally. Even if you have no intention of sharing the code, you can still get a lot of benefit from using git locally in the form of being able to go back to previous iterations of your code. Gone are the \"what did I do? this was working before\" moments. And if it eventually turns into something you do want to share, it's easy to push that entire local repo to an online repo.&#x200B;>\"Come up with your own ideas and then build them\"Way easier said than done, as you've discovered. I've never really thought about something like Upwork as a means of getting an \"assignment\" to work on. When I was a beginner, I would have been worried about signing up for something that I wouldn't be able to do. And that whatever result I produced would be awful. But I suppose if you're honest and charging a low enough amount, they will know what they are getting and everyone wins."

Congratulations on becoming an inventor because if you thought that developing software was not creating a new invention you are mistaken. The fact that what you just created can't be bought off-the-shelf proves that software development is bespoke and by definition a new invention. Heck, the US Patent Office will even allow you to patent your software if it's novel enough so it must be an invention and you, my friend, ARE an Inventor! Embrace it. Trial and error is what we do as software developers. I've been coding for 40 years (yes, I'm that old and I still have my original Apple \\]\\[+) and I still write snippets on Python code in the interpreter to see if they will work before I paste them into whatever I'm working on. That's how you do it. That's how every industry does it. Automobile designers don't create a drawing and hand it to the factory and a car pops out of the assembly line. They test and prototype and see what works and what doesn't. It's all part of inventing something new... like a software program. I actually hold the patent for a [Virtual sales person for electronic catalog](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6035283) which I patented back in 1997 at the dawn of the Internet. It was a series of trials and errors until I hit on something that worked.Automobile designers also don't reinvent the wheel (literally) they include them in their design. That's no different than you taking code snippets from Google and incorporating them into your program. That's called \"reuse\" and every good programmers does it. The skill is in knowing *what* to reuse and *how* to adapt it to your situation and, it is a skill that is acquired over time. Don't be ashamed of it. Every inventor looks for parts that they can readily use in their new invention. Software development is no different.Think about what we do as software developers. It's like alchemy! We open an editor and it's blank. Nothing there. Empty. Then we wiggle our fingers and suddenly there is running software that performs some useful task. We just created something... out of nothing! It is nothing short of magic. :-DThis is an outstanding and well written article that you should turn into a blog post somewhere like medium. It is too good to be buried in a thread. That's your next goal... to start blogging about your software adventures to help others with their inventive process... and it is a process that everyone has to discover what works for them. Not everything you build will be a new novel invention; some will be a variation on an old idea, but don't kid yourself, you are an inventor and when you start building novel software, don't forget to patent it. You are at the start of an incredible journey. Embrace it!"

I tried doing this a while back on a government website for tracking covid data using Requests and BeautifulSoup and was unsuccessful.  I see you mention that you are using selenium to load and extract data from multiple pages.  This option never occurred to me (and the program was just something I tried on a whim, so I wasn't trying that hard), but it seems to me like a program using selenium would take a long time to do this many pages of information.  So how long does it take for your program to scrape and format the data?  And does selenium run headless or actually open a browser to perform the operations?"

I was in a similar situation and eventually managed to get a full-time job as a dev, and just after a week or two, (with 0 experience) I was thrown onto a real project, where I had to use React for the FE (never touched it before), Python for the BE (had some tutorial experience and few really small projects) and also API gateway (didn't know it even exists).I was able to manage it all somehow, and I learned a lot. One real project > dozens of tutorials.But, the thing that bothers me is that I 'hack' things too much. I don't have a feeling that I quite understand why am I using this solution and if I get stuck I just randomly try out different stuff until it works. After that, I decided to join CS50 from Harvard and that totally changed my perspective. The two most important building blocks of programming are data structures and algorithms, without that, you will never understand how everything works, which solution is efficient, and which not, for a certain situation. So, my advice is: learn the basics really well, especially data structures and some basic algorithms, then do one or two good tutorials and after that, focus on building your own stuff.P.S As I said in the beginning, this might not be that important if you plan to do just frontend, or just web scraping, but even for those areas, it can be really helpful."

I finished my bachelors is software engineering and have played around with code for years but never felt like a great programmer because I never did it in a professional setting nor have I made anything of my own.  I usually start and then get the deer in the headlights look.  I started realizing that planning everything is way more than coding.  I would try to make projects from scratch but with no real passion for making a \"to-do list\" it never got far.  Then I see people able to create and move through functions and make different loops that if I read makes sense but I could never create off the top of my head(or at least I dont think I can).  Impostrr syndrome hits so hard especially coming from tutorials.  The greatest thing that you hit on is the race.  I find myself beating myself up if I'm not doing programming stuff every when I'm at my machine, but I need to realize it's on my time.  Planning our an hour a day can get me so far if I just stick it!!I do want to complete some courses fully.  Hopefully 2021 will be my year."

I finally found something that I wanted to do with python, my first API call to a website at work, because I do a lot of data analysis ( I love it) I make a lot of dashboards, I am sick of the multiple steps I take just to update my dashboards so I wanted to automate it with python and an api call to our e-commerce site was the first step. It took me literary almost half a year to get to this step (I just started writing the api), so much wasted time because of lack of focus but better start sometime or you'll be lamenting for months when you could have learned python. This was the hardest part, getting motivated and finding a project to do that interests me. Also believing in myself. It is so much fun when the damn thing works but extremely frustrating when it doesn't and your Google-fu fails you to find an answer. Sleeping on it, in my case is the best solution because the next day the solution magically presents itself."

Yet, I don't know where I should have used a better structure or technique.I would say this is also another point that I picked up from somewhere, sinking more time into code which works isn't always necessary.  If it works and it's legible enough that somebody can understand what's going on, I think that's enough as a beginner.I recently started adding doc strings to functions and commentary to my code as well as adding lengthier names to variables as a way of instead of improving my code from a language point of view but rather a collaboration point of view.> There may not be an easy answer, but that's the \"beginning\" of programming that keeps hurting me now.As another beginner, I know this feeling all too well hahaha.

                "comment": "Don’t forget product! It’s easy to focus on refactoring code, but focus on solving pain points in your product first. You got it to a usable state, that’s called the minimum viable product (mvp). Think about the user next, even if it’s just you, are you still annoyed that such-and-such isn’t automated, or is there an extra ability that would solve an annoying manual step? For example, I built an indeed.com scraper that acts as a super-filter for removing jobs. Once that was done, I was qualified for 70% of descriptions I read vs 3% before my product. That saved me a ton of time and frustration. Next, I simply had too many opportunities to know which was best. I created a field so user can enter a relevant word and assign a point value (if SaaS is in the description, +5 points, if FinTech then another +3 points, etc.). Adding the matching words feature was not part of the original plan, but I had 2 choices- I could spend time refactoring my code, or I could add in a feature that adds tremendous value to solving my pain points. Granted, I still refactor my code, but never at a time when I could be solving high-priority problems or adding pain-solving features. I would also say that refactoring existing code feels harder than just writing better code next time. I wrote a program before learning about itertools, but I didn’t refactor my existing code because saving milliseconds for that project simply didn’t matter. My next projects used itertools and it was natural to code it in fresh- but sometimes I chose not to bother with it because the processing time it saves is just not worth the extra thought in many situations, especially on small projects. So just saying, completed projects don’t just benefit from refactoring, you also can use that time to step into a product mentality and think through the pain points you or your users are experiencing. Refactoring certainly becomes priority when a particular code block breaks a bunch of processes any time anything about it is changed- at a certain point you save more time by refactoring from the beginning."

Can you share by what strategy you found your client, and presented yourself? HelpI'm glad you found the post helpful!When it comes to talking to clients and negotiating, I have a little experience as a Chemist.  The most important thing is to be realistic - if something is hard, but will lead to other things, it can be worth taking for a slightly lower price.  If it's too much work, speak up and let them know.  Negotiation is a matter of asking what you think your time is worth.  Of course, people will try and lowball you but don't get disheartened or bullied into accepting less money.With the client I had, they were really nice and cooperative, although didn't explain things very well.  What I did is re-explain what I think they want and if they say yes, they can't come back and say, 'this is not what I wanted'.  If not, I can ask for clarity.  Be polite, patient, and do all you can to remove any confusion.  Don't rush the communication and all will be okay.I found the client via upwork, the process is all written out above with similar questions answered in the previous thread."

So how long does it take for your program to scrape and format the data? And does selenium run headless or actually open a browser to perform the operations?The program I wrote took just under 15 minutes to run.  Scraping takes the longest with around 2-3 minutes of waits and for the webdriver to open up the page and formatting the least which is pretty much instant as soon as it gets the file.The one I used isn't running headerless at the mo because I wanted to open the browser and cross-check that the program is scraping the data correctly, it's navigating correctly etc etc and it's nice having a visual cue.Ultimately it depends on the speed of your computer (I'm running an i7-2600), speed of your internet and how you're scraping certain stuff.

I essentially found a lot of what I know out by accident or constantly searching until something shows up.  If you try and scrape a site and you're confident you have your path correct, then it's very likely to be a dynamic website and will require an approach different to the one you're doing.If nothing works, I would try searching your errors and seeing if anybody can explain why something is wrong, or even posting on this subreddit with the code you've tried.

In short, there's no point trying to reinvent the wheel and if somebody has done perfectly fine code, there's nothing wrong with you taking it and repurposing it for your variables.  You had a problem and needed to solve it with code - you now have the answer.  On top of that, a programmer isn't expected to remember absolutely everything off the top of their head and that's something that's always reiterated in courses.  Having a good approach is what's encouraged over memorising.> my worry is that when I don't know how to solve something, I google it and it has all the answers right there for me. However, since the answer is right there, there's no need for me to add any code since it does the job I want it to do. As problems get more complex and unique, it's very rare you'll be able to take huge chunks of code from the internet and it's ready to go.

I had to learn a lot about request headers, using chrome's F12 network tab, ect.  Honestly It was a lot of trial and error without knowing exactly how it worked.

Some video tutorials do not cover what I want, others cover it in 5 minutes.If you're unsure what to use, it's likely that you'll want to physically try applying some of the solutions you've found on the internet to your own code and try to get it to work.  If it doesn't work after using similar approaches (e.g. same library, loop structure, logic) after several times, it's time to change your approach.I found learning through failure and trying something else is a very efficient way of figuring out what does and doesn't suck.  It's mentally draining though.  On the plus side, you get a lot better at googling for specific stuff.  One thing I searched for the other day was \"how to turn a local variable from a function into a global variable\" and realised that I've found looking for solutions difficult because I've been far too vague this entire time."

I'd be blown away.You can do things like sew tiny leds into your design.  If it lit up each line as it 'executed' in a loop that would be just so damn awesome.  The code wouldn't be THAT hard...you'd be simply activating an array of pins in the appropriate order.  Python CAN be used for arduino projects.But this is way cool enough.  I was just tossing that out there.  The python you'd need wouldn't be any harder, easier in fact, but stepping into the electronics could be a learning curve that can't be surmounted in time.  But if you have the time and want to learn it...you'd of course have skills you could use in other embroidery projects.I have to also say that your idea is just AWESOME!  I would have never thought of it and I'm sure I'd cry like a baby.  I almost don't want to say anything for fear it will make you doubt your idea.  Don't...this is just something that would be that much more....for me.  This is the best damn thing I ever heard of."

Popen, using the execv family of calls, gives you a lot more control.It's a similar deal in standard C. You could use the function `system()` which just takes a string, or you could use some sort of execv call and pass in a very specific list of arguments, custom environment variables, etc.Also not sure `shlex.split` alone is great for this specific thing. Since osascript is running an arbitrary script, I believe you might even be able to pass in malicious input with a custom title that terminates the `\"` and still allow for injection, even if only osascript is running. Normally `os.system` is vulnerable because you could do command injection and the shell would run another program... in this case, you might be able to do bad things with osascript itself, and do more than just display a notification.Edit:yep, tested it. You could pass in:`notify('foo', 'bar\"\\nset volume output muted TRUE\\ndisplay notification \"foo2\" with title \"bar2')`Displays two notifications and mutes my macbook. You literally have to do your own input sanitization if you're launching osascript, whether you use `subprocess` or `os.system`. Since that second title still goes in as a single argument, `shlex.split` and using the `subprocess` calls don't matter, you might not have shell injection but you have applescript injection."

Think about it...Command injection is one issue. `os.system` won't protect against that. Due to the way subprocess.Popen works, you can pass in a very specific list of arguments. `&& something` won't work, because it's not running as a shell command, rather executing a child process using the execv sorts of calls.If you've seen C before, you might have seen:`void main(int argc, char *argv[]) {`That argv is an array of arguments that it runs with. When you use something like Popen and a list of arguments, it goes directly in there. That means adding `&& rm -rf /*` won't run the `rm` program... it'll pass the arguments `&&` and `rm` and `-rf` and `/*` to the actual program you were trying to run, which it likely won't be able to do anything with, and just break.`os.system` uses the C system function which will pass that string to the shell, which WILL parse that as trying to run the first program, then `rm`.Popen also gives you a lot more control. You can pipe input into stdin, get stdout and stderr and pipe that to something else, you can get a process instance and send it signals, like kill it, you can pass in custom environment variables, you can wait on it to finish. `os.system` just runs it and doesn't give you any control over it after that.Edit: in this specific case, since it's running osascript which itself has a scripting language that you're running with that `display notification` command, you actually are still vulnerable to command injection here no matter what you use. You have to sanitize the input or people can do bad things, [example here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/gfaq9s/handy_python_functions_for_all/fpupaxk/)"

Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.* This Udemy course covers the same content as the book, which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python will be posted on the website in mid-November. It gets released on the 12th, and I'll need a couple days to format it to HTML and make it look nice.* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)* I used to do free codes once or twice a year. The last time I did, I had an amazing 80,000 people sign up (so a dozen of them might have actually finished the course, if people are as good as I am about finishing the online courses I sign up for). Udemy's new policies mean I can't do this anymore. I find this to be a less than ideal situation. So I'm rolling out new codes each month. NOV2019FREE is the free code, and NOV2019 is the cheap code. I'll come out with new ones at the start of each month. (And yes, I'll probably write a script to automate this.)"

They should just be honest and say, “It’s better for our bottom line”. At least we could begrudgingly respect their honesty. Disclosure: I have courses on Udemy (soon to be removed from sale).Thanks for making your work free; it’s much appreciated, and I know much effort goes into it. (I’m also a published author)."

If you visit Udemy using a incognito mode in your browser, you will always see the ‘new student’ discount, and will pay that price even when you sign-in to pay via an existing account (assuming that the instructor allow discounts, which most do).Also, are you aware that there is a 30 day money-back guarantee on all Udemy courses, so you could get a refund and still get the course with a coupon? Some people may think this is less than honest, but as a Udemy instructor and author, I am happy for students to do this with my courses, so I am not being a hypocrite. There’s nothing worse than a disgruntled customer; I’d rather have a happy customer and less money."

But when it comes to larger professional project, Pycharm is my choice. The debugger is just perfect and intuitive, it allows you to track variables value right inside the code (it actually prints the variable state beside the variable in your code) and this is a great feature also when you are learning new tools. Moreover Its integration with anaconda, git and Jenkins couldn’t work any better"

I think this was because they wanted for us to work on an environment where we depend on ourselves 100% in writing syntax with no help of the IDE like autocomplete and finding errors and auto brackets and so on.. I really don't know if their theory is correct or not but it makes sense to me although I really hated jGrasp.."

But after using Python I really like actually took the time to rice VSCode and started using it as a main editor. Microsoft really brings out the best of Python and VSCode together. I noticed that it was just waaay better than PyCharm while being lightweight and not needing that stupid indexing that Pycharm. Once you start using VSCode with Python, you   realize just how much its ahead than PyCharm. Imho, Python is meant to be coded in conjunction with VSCode."

The UX is fantastic for what they support, but there is so much they still don't. And VS Intellisense is pretty garbage compared to Pycharm's code completion. The latter also is amazing at type inference, even figuring type info from docstrings, which is so empowering and awesome. Haven't been able to get that working in Vscode."

Pycharm will index the entire project along with dependencies. It even does type inference based on docstrings. It is amazingly flexible at figuring out the type of something in your code and providing you meaningful auto-complete options. That comes at a cost, especially on startup.Vscode on the other hand does practically none of that, and it shows when comparing the quality of auto-complete suggestions or even its ability to reason about imports, etc.As for remote development, I'd go as far as to say that VSCode's approach is the gold standard when it comes to remote development. It is simply phenomenal and provides an outstanding UX. Basically, they've architected vscode such that you can connect to a remote server (could be a docker container, or another machine, etc) and it installs a vscode + python server/engine on the backend and files are accessed via SSH but appear as if on your local machine. All the code parsing + intelligence is happening on the server machine and the VSCode client just acts as a userinterface connecting you to the backend vscode server. The experience is outstanding and far superior to Pycharm's super clunky SFTP based approach of uploading files to the remote server as you make local edits."

That is one thing it does really well imo and I will sometimes use it only as a Git client to review diffs and merge conflicts. The vscode interface for git stuff is far superior to that of Pycharm. It's just all the other things that Pycharm does so much better than vscode when it comes to Python stuff that makes it impossible to switch to vscode for full-time python dev work for me."

IntelliJ makes some great software, but at the moment I don't have a need for their software.  If you are haappy using PyCharm and related IntelliJ projects than stick with it.For example, just because I started using VSCode doesn't mean I stopped using Emacs, there are some functions that are implemented that cannot be easily cloned by other IDEs. For example, Emacs still has super good org mode support that VSCode does not have.Same goes for VIM, there are certain things that VIM can do more comfortably than Emacs and vice versa.At the end of the day, all of these are just tools. I would start using Eclipse again, if they got their shit together as well. Heck, eclipse was my first python ide :)Heck, Sublime Text is also a must install for me because it also has some things that other editors can't do super well. Notepad++ is also amazing as well."

Coding would be the knowledge. But your tool really is git.

When you make changes, it uploads them to the remote via SFTP. I believe it does still let you connect/run on the remote venv/python install but it is generally a lot more clunky because the remote location for your project is usually in some weird temp/pycharm dir. Apparently they are working on rearchitecting so they can have a similar UX as Vscode, but this is a huge effort as they have to fundamentally change the architecture of their product. But they do recognize that they need a better solution for remote development as vscode is currently eating their lunch in that space, and it is an ever more important space with the rise of container-based development."

And I find Python so damn hard, especially the looping because I just can't figure out tutorial problems till i see a solution on the web or through the university's proprietary discussion board. Its like my brain is just struggling to come up with solutions to these tutorial problems.But when I do see other students post solutions to the problems, they make it seem so simple, and I'm always left scratching my head as to why I couldn't get it in the first place.Well I guess I just need to practice more and your post has inpired me to not give up.Thank You."

Every day I hit wall after wall of problems I have no idea how to solve, and feel like I'm constantly fighting our framework of choice. But I love it. I'm finally doing it every day, and someone is actually paying me to do so. I can hardly believe it. Your story reads just like mine, with only a few differences:- I'm a machine learning engineer, not a software developer.- I've been in the role for about 10 months now, not 6 weeks.- It took me about 1.5-2 years, not 7, to go from absolutely nothing to where I am now.Like you, all the skills I use at work (coding, math, stats, analysis) are 100% self-taught - I never took a relevant class in school, never studied comp sci, nothing like that - and as a result my job is just a constant firehose of things that are completely beyond me. But that is the nature of the work and the path we have chosen, so despite the endless challenges, I too love it and am thankful every day for where I am.Very happy we've both found our passion and that we both got there by good old-fashioned hard work. Turns out dreams really do come true :) Cheers!"

If you're looking to truely understand Oop, in my humble opinion I would try these steps:0. Google any and all of the words you don't know that I'm about to say.1. Learn the basics of Java. Java doesn't have to be the language, , but if you're serious about Oop it can help because it's strongly attached to that paradigm2. Start learning design techniques and patterns. (Techniques first) things like composition, inherentence, and then prehaps polymorphism3. Start building MVC structure apps (model, view, controller) this is really the building blocks to basic project layout and understanding how to create something useful.4. Find an API framework like spring boot (java), django (python), express (javascript) and start learning it. Basically an API is the MC (model, controller) part of MVC, and then you just use the web to create the V (view)"

It removes the absolute requirement to have made the correct decisions in your 20’s in order to succeed later in life. In a line, it means neither your college major nor your first job necessarily define your future.As long as you pick up the skills - which can (theoretically at least) be done at any stage of life - you can follow whichever path you want.

It’s much, much more difficult to create an ecosystem of scripts that reuse functions and integrate together smoothly. It’s extremely difficult for a single person to develop an entire system. Be conscious of what you are trying to create. Always think about how to reuse that quick little script that you wrote. Doc strings are your friends. When creating a report, always print the name of the generating script with a date and time stamp in a banner so you immediately know how to get the report next month/quarter.Print each function and put it in a three ring binder so it’s easy to flip through and refresh yourself what the expected input and output are. If you are not using Git or some other version control system, you are building your own software version of the Titanic.  Been there, done that.. Good luck!"

To echo what some other people have mentioned, you're going to get to a point where you have a crap ton of little scripts that are hard to maintain (speaking from experience). My advice is to organize your code and understand OOP, abstraction is going to help a lot. If you write code to be generic instead of one off you will reduce a lot of headaches down the road. Also familiarize yourself with an architecture pattern like test driven design or domain driven design when you feel comfortable. I wish I had from the start."

I automated accruals that were able to consider a lot more info than the accountants could, although of course still gets looked over. We have a pretty complex revenue model which would be reconciled by a team of accountants every month, I automated that. Tons of IO between our systems. I created a small database explorer that allows departments to directly access tables in the database and build their own custom reports and queries with all the logic they want (this wouldn’t be necessary if we had a proper i information system). I basically turned the accounting department into a small data entry team and compressed all of the info so that it can be looked over by a quarter of the staff. Budgets, all automated. I created a shit ton of reports (again prolly wouldn’t be necessary with a proper IS). Probably forgetting stuff but that’s most of the big stuff. I’ve now pivoted a bit and moved to creating larger applications. But I’m also trying to get away from accounting, I have a SAAS company that has been growing quite a bit and after hiring engineers I’ve come to realize that I don’t really want to be a SE, but rather just want a good enough understanding of software to properly run my company. And now I also have a skill most business owners dont, the accounting.Hope this helps, feel free to ask other stuffProbably more I’m forgetting, aut"

It builds on other python .pdf libraries that I initially found and tried to custom create a solution from. The readme on GitHub references those if you do not find the design of invoice2data helpful for your use. But, finding invoice2data certainly me helped create something much faster and reliable without much work beyond learning the core features of the library.The key is to get vendor buy-in, at least in my business. For some companies it can be a struggle to get them to send .pdf files even though most accounting systems they use can easily generate them. I have had more than one discussion as well about sending a .pdf with text and not just a .pdf containing an image that is a scan of a physical printed copy of the invoice. In theory, invoice2data has Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, but I wanted to avoid some of the flaws of that technology in favor of working with extracted text directly from the file.Edit:To add, I think there a better methods of sharing data between businesses than individual invoice transfer through email using .pdf files. However, as I said before, the ease of generating individual documents and the familiarity of other companies with this process made this a strong option. Trying to convince a vendor to send aggregated data or different file formats seemed more difficult than asking them to slightly update a process they likely already had in place."

I have an idea in my head on how to do it etc. but would need to work it out exactly. For example tying assets out etc. Because its all a bunch of rules that can be coded and AJEs can be created automatically. However, I have yet to get approval and the potential is about the only thing keeping me working right now"

I feel like that sounds like a really good project. That’s how I got started, I automated:-JE creation to be imported-budgets, old budget system was a disaster-reconciliations, we did monthly revenue reconciliations, I automated all of the calculations and generated end user reportsOtherwise if that’s not an option, I would recommend you try to come up with some data analysis thesis, and then prove yourself right or wrong using things like..-web scraping-doing all of the calculations, spending time making them more efficient-creating end user reports and summaries-creating a GUIThe stuff you need does snowball quickly, at first I only learned VBA because I was realllly good at excel. So I could basically combine my excel knowledge with programming to produce good work. But now I use python for backend, JavaScript, html, css for frontend.So basically the GUI is made to run in the browser (I use electron because then I don’t have to write code that runs on 90 browsers), then when the user enters their settings or whatever, clicks button, it sends request to python server which then does the heavy lifting, then returns back to them end user reports in html/JS/css.You could also maybe try to heavily rely on excel at first? It makes things like a GUI kinda easy because you can use cells as inputs, and then access the values with VBA. If you want to skip that step, I’d recommend using something like pysimplegui or if you want to jump right in, use pyqt for the GUI. I’d try to do some work on your own if you can before you push them too hard, because if they wanted a programmer, they could hire a programmer, so you have to prove you’re kinda able to do both. Sorry this was just kinda a rant, I’m not trying to scare you away, feel free to ask more specific questions"

I really hate how hardware keeps improving, but we keep adding crap that people don't need and computers are subjectively slower than they were in the 90s.I just stick with Bootstrap as a lightweight way of making reactive web design. I use Pelican for my static blog generator (I've long since realized I don't need a comment system on my blog posts.)A couple months ago I made the switch of all my png and jpg images to webp. It's actually a great and well-supported image format, and the file sizes are about 33% or 50% smaller."

Class names should use the CapWords convention and there's no need to have the pair of parentheses after (unless you're inheriting from another class) so your class declaration should just be `class Cat:`. The parentheses when you instantiate an instance of the class are either empty to create an instance without passing any attributes or they pass those attributes to the `__init__` method of the class.Also by putting `breed` as a class attribute you're applying it to all cats - doing it like that, you can only have one breed of cat among all of your cat instances, instead of a unique breed for each one if you put it as an instance attribute instead. This is obviously just an example you've put together so it could be nothing but I thought it was worth pointing out."

But it still functions as a class in classig OOP.Self - Is a reference to an instance from an instance method in a class. It can point to an attribute the instance is expected to have or call a different instance method.Instance methods can only be called with a defined instance of the class, and when calling instance methods with the instance, the self is pointing to the specific calling methods.For example:if there is a Cat class with an \\_\\_init\\_\\_(bed) that defines a self.bed from the bed param . an instance method sit\\_on\\_bed(self) would utilize self.bed, thus when an instance of cat with a specific bed instance calls cat.sit\\_on\\_bed() - The cat will be seated on the bed instance assigned for it  and not on any other bed belonging to other cat or human instance.`class Cat(...)`  `def __init__(bed...):`  `self.bed = bed...``...``def sit_on_bed(self):`  `self.move(self.bed.position)`  `self.sit()``...``bad_3 = Bed(...)`  `cat_3 = Cat(bed=bed_3...)`  `cat.sit_on_bed() # Cat goes to sit on it's designated bed`Of course cats don't really work like that but that's the beauty of writing your own cats."

                "comment": "Regarding **self**:TLDR:**self** is just a reserved parameter position in functions connected to a specific class which tells that function on which object to perform some actions (if there are any).Explanation:Forget what you know about classes and methods and think about them in simpler terms - the way creators of Python probably thought about them and how they work under the hood. They probably first wrote how general objects work and, after that, how functions work.Then they probably thought - oh let's create classes, but how do we do it without changing something that works well already (objects, functions)?Classes are just fancy objects that can create other objects which we call instances. They are mostly syntactic sugar (kind of) which makes it easier for you, the programmer, to write code in quicker and easier way.Methods are simple functions - but how do you make simple functions work like methods? Well, in order to continue that syntactic sugar flowing, they made it easy to be called by creating a simple link with the class, so you can just use dot notation to call up a method like `class_instance.method(params)`. But - since they are still simple functions, those functions still need object as parameters on which they can perform some actions. And how did creators solve that? Well they just said: \"Each time you call a function/method, you have to pass an object which you want that function to work on, so let's put it on a first place of parameters passed.\"**self** is just an agreed name which could've been anything else, the idea is that **you are passing an object to be used and in case you are using dot notation (**`class_instance.method(...params)`**),  that specific class instance will be automatically passed as the argument.**You can return that object in the method/function you invoked and that will allow you to chain other functions on that same object/instance, which simplifies code further.&#x200B;On the other hand, if it makes sense for you to do so, you can pass any object as an argument to a class method by calling it as `Class.method(other_object, ...params)` and that object will take place of **self** parameter.&#x200B;Maybe somewhat weird example on this last part:    class MathFormula:            def __init__(self, initial_value):            self.result = initial_value            def add(self, num):            self.result += num            return self               # returns the whole instance/object to enable method chaining            def substract(self, num):            self.result -= num            return self               # returns the whole instance/object to enable method chaining            simple_calc = MathFormula(5).add(2).substract(1)        print(simple_calc.result)    # 6        # no need to specify which object to use - self parameter     # takes this specific instance    simple_calc.add(5)        print(simple_calc.result)    # 11        print(simple_calc)    # prints out memory location of class instance / object        # chain methods and access only instance property, an integer    final = simple_calc.add(9).substract(5).result    print(final)    # 15            # Let's say we make another class with \"result\" property    class Number:            def __init__(self, initial_value):            self.result = initial_value            # initialization    different_calc = Number(10)        print(different_calc)    # prints out memory location of class instance / object        print(different_calc.result)    # 10        # invoke another classes's method and pass an instance/object    # to be used as a \"self\" parameter        MathFormula.add(different_calc, 5)    MathFormula.substract(different_calc, 3)    print(different_calc.result)    # 12        MathFormula.substract(different_calc, 7).add(9)        # Throws an error    # Chaining methods doesn't work since \"return self\" of    # MathFormula.substract() method returns    # different_calc object, which is an instance of class Number    # and therefor doesn't have add() methodEdit: formattingLast edit:   I am just a noob.

                "comment": "Edit: warning, the stuff I wrote here might be completely the opposite, especially based on the reply I got.  It's possible that self is actually LESS restricted than non-self.  I was under the impression that self meant more privacy, but it might mean more openness to sharing. To answer your question about self - I am new with objects (well, I used them for one class - no pun intended - like 10 years ago and then never used them again until I relearned them last week), but the impression I have is that self variables are like local variables, and normal variables are global. So you know how if I did while True:....I=10....print(I)....breakprint(I)the second print would break the program because I only exists inside of the while loop (since that's where I created it?)I believe when you do a self, it makes that variable only inside of the object that is created from the class.  I want to say that if you do this:class aClass(self):....def __init__(self):....self.a = 10....b = 20That if you try to do a print of b outside of the object, it should work.  Again, I could be wrong, but I also know that for sure you can't do print(a) outside of an object made out of the aClass.So at least the way I see it, self.variable is a local variable (or a private if you use other languages) and a non self is probably a global/public."

I'm going to make some comments inline. Mostly not because you're incorrect, but to add some more info.&#x200B;* *byte code -  representation of the python program in the interpreter** *complex numbers - extension of the familiar number system which all numbers are expressed as real and imaginary*I think you're mostly correct here. There is a whole lot more to complex numbers (Complex analysis is an entire branch of mathematics). I personally prefer to think of the real numbers as a subset of the complex numbers (those where the imaginary part is 0) because then it's obvious that things which are true about complex numbers are also true about the real numbers. This is outside what you need to know for python, I just think complex numbers are really cool :)* *decorator - A function that modifies another function. Return value is a callable object*This is one that most new python programmers (unless you came from another language with this concept) really struggle. I think you've got the write idea. I've deleted what I wrote at first because it got into the weeds and doesn't help learn python. Just know that the most common use case is to create a reusable pattern that will happen whenever a function gets called. I'll often use decorators to modify every function in a webapp that I want to make sure a user has authenticated before calling.e.g:`@authenticated``def return_user_info():``...`* *dictionary - A python datatype composed of keys + values. Can be a variety of data types*This is mostly correct. The keys can only be hashable types (tuples, not lists for example).&#x200B;* *duck typing - object properties determine what it is.*if it walks like an integer and talks like an integer it's probably an integer :)"

This doesn't take too long, but it's adds up for every month and every website. So I tried to make a program that parses text from the clipboard into a list, deletes empty lines, then puts the shorter list back into the clipboard... If you've done a few chapters of Al Sweigart's book, this is fairly straightforward (with a bit of help from Google). My program works, and for now I've copied the program and made a few tweaks so it works with different sources (e.g. Amazon orders list, Paypal orders list, bank account statements...). You can always make your programs fancier/more efficient, but focus on getting them to work first."

Sure enough, it worked pretty well.  Do you know how to use structs in C?  Or dictionaries in python?  If so, you essentially have been using objects secretly. Admittedly I'm still not converted and still prefer to use procedural, but it's probably because I need more practice - I may become a believer if I program more in it.  But yeah, if you're bored enough, look at my repository in github.com/MOABdaliSpecifically my stockwars game.  It goes from procedural to classes within like a two day period - I literally watched videos about objects for a few hours (mainly Corey Schafer's video) and then spent like 8 hours modifying my code in small chunks (\"alright, this can go with my stocks object... This one with the player object, and this one belongs with player..... Actually, let's make that one be its own map class... Yeah, that works\") and voila, cut my code by about 600 lines. Classes in my opinion are harder to understand and read when reading code (just like I think it's easier to read print 1print 2print 3print 4than for (I in range (5)):...print IBut I guess technically the second one is nicer looking and is less of a hassle when scrolling around code that has dozens of these types of statements.  This is also true of classes (and functions) - harder to read, but much smaller I guess."

                "comment": "Corey Schafer's video on classes :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM) This video is helped me really well to understand the idea of classes and the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ methodself was something that gave me an \"aha\" a while ago.... so basically if you have seen examples of oop people use \"self\" for mostly two things - 1) to create these variables inside classes and 2) as arguments to functions defined in a class (all functions in a class have atleast one argument that is \"self\")&#x200B;Now classes are blueprints of objects. That means that from a single class you can create an object any number of times and these objects have properties (attributes) and behaves according to the methods (functions) defined in the class. The process of creating objects from a class is called instantiation and a particular object is an instance of that class. Now objects are \"things\" that changes according to its methods. For example, if  you consider a door as an object, then it has an attribute ie door\\_state which can be open or closed. It has a method that acts on the door and changes its door state ie making it open or closed. lets call that function door\\_move(). Now how is the door object and its method door\\_move() related. the method door\\_move() acts on the object door ie takes the object \"door\" as an input, does something to it, in this case change the attribute door\\_state from closed to open, and outputs the object but with the necessary change. But remember we were writing just the class door and we havent created any door objects from it yet. So we need our door\\_move() function to always act on any instance of our class door so that it can act on that particular door instance. So \"self\" refers to the particular object created from a class while it is being instantiated and after ie so that all instances of that class will have their own door\\_move() method that acts on their respective objects. &#x200B;    class door:        self.door_state = \"closed\"        def door_move(self):            if self.door_state == \"closed\":                self.door_state = \"open\"            else:                self.door_state = \"closed\"        door_1 = door()    \\_\\_init\\_\\_ methods are functions that are called ie acts on their objects everytime an object is being created. Now in the above code the method dooe\\_move() does nothing unless called like this    door_1.door_move()and that's why \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method just as its name suggests suitable for initializing object attributes. Say your are creating 1000 objects. Each object is a person working in your company. So you will have different attributes such as first name, last name, salary etc.And if you were to do things without the init method then you have to manually change all these attributes in each object once you create them.&#x200B;    class Employees:        self.fname = None        self.lname = None        self.salary = None        Employee_1 = Employee()    Employee_2 = Employee()    .....        And then once you have created all these employees who are instances of your Employee class, you will have to manually change their fname, lname and so on    Employee_1.fname = \"Richard\"    Employee_1.lname = \"James\"    Employee_1.salary = \"$10,000\"and you have to do that for all the employers and for each of their attributesInstead with init method you can do it much easily as    def Employee:        def __init__(self, fname, lname, salary)            self.fname = fname            self.lname = lname            self.salary = salaryand once you have done that you just need to pass these values fname, lname etc as arguments while you are creating individual Employee objects like this :&#x200B;    Employee_1 = Employee(\"Richard\",\"James\",\"$10,000\")in self.fname = fname in fact you can change fname to anything only in LHS because in the left side fname is an attrubute of an object whereas on RHS it is the string value of that attribute (which you can call pretty much anything). But if you change it on RHS you will have to make the same change in the argument of the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method. &#x200B;Hope it helps !"

Technically it's stupid because no one would actually do that in real life, and if they did, I could just run it in a compiler.

                "comment": "Okay, let's not go too far ahead with mind shattering. :D**Self** actually has only one definition - it's an object that is being passed/used/invoked. But, even that is a wrong view of **self** \\- it's no a magic object or a magic keyword.It's an just a name for an object. Now, the important thing to figure out is **WHICH** object that is.    class Car():        brand = \"Ford\"            def __init__(self, car_color):            self.color = car_color            def change_color(self, new_color):            self.color = new_color            def change_brand(self, new_brand):            self.brand = new_brand        new_car = Car(\"red\")1. When you make new instance of a class (eg. `new_car = Car(\"blue\")` ), this is what happens:2. A new object gets created in the memory, that object is a child/instance of class `Car()`, it's not assigned to the variable yet, it's just created in the memory3. All global properties and methods made in the class are assigned to this newly created object ( `type = \"Ford\", __init__(), change_color(), change_type()` ). If class has global/class properties, like `brand = \"Ford\"` in the above example, this property is assigned to the newly created object.  This means that all methods and class properties will be callable through dot notation *object*.`change_color()` or *object*`.brand` later on. **(we are not finished yet)**4. This is where all connections between the *CLASS* object which pumps out new objects and the *NEWLY CREATED OBJECT* **stop.** There is no more ties there, *CLASS* object assigned everything it had to this new object and it's on its own - all further access to methods and properties is **directly** from those assigned to this new object. Keep this in mind.5. After that all properties and methods are assigned to this newly created object which is still just sitting in the memory, it's `__init__` method is invoked, the same one that was assigned to it, and **that very same object gets to be passed as an argument (self) to this method - object is simply passing itself as an argument to its own method/function - that's why that argument is always named as** ***self.***6. After all of that, this newly created object is returned and can be assigned to a variable. I am not sure if this step is the last one, but it doesn't make much difference when it occurs since it doesn't affect anything regarding object using itself as a parameter.So, in the end, you get a new object which is assigned to a variable, eg. :    new_car = Car(\"red\")If you want to invoke a method on this object, say `change_brand()` method, that object will check if it has such method assigned to it and if it does, it will:\\- call it up- pass itself as a parameter first **(self)**\\- pass other parameters that were supplied    def change_brand(self, new_brand):            self.brand = new_brandIf you are referring to global class properties in any of the methods, like `brand = \"Ford\"`, you have to understand that methods don't have any reference to the Class object you used in order to create a new object - they basically don't have access to anything. Global class properties were assigned to the newly created object during its creation, while *CLASS was pumping it out*, and as we said *- after that all the connections stop.* Therefor, after object itself is passed to the method as a **self** argument, you can access global class properties only by using dot notation on that reference: `self.brand = new_brand` \\- it's like typing `new_car.brand = new_brand` (replace `new_car` with whichever variable you assigned this object to). This is because you are only operating on this newly created object, class has nothing to do with it, and everything that class had is assigned to this object, and the only way to access it and it's properties in the method is to pass object itself to that method and then use dot notation inside. <- weird sentence but I think you get itSooo, to sum it up, **self** means nothing by itself, it's just a word replacement for an object you are passing to a function. If that function is assigned to that object (method), that object will pass itself to it first, and then other parameters.Now, since you understand that newly created object is a separate thing from class objects (which are just factories), you might understand too why it's possible to invoke methods by using class objects on its own - like in my previous post. Since they are not invoked by a newly created object (instance), it doesn't get passed automatically so you have to pass it on your own as the first argument (this is where **self** as a keyword doesn't make any sense). It can be any object, as long as it makes sense. I am not sure this practical, to be honest, but it helps to illustrate a bit how all this stuff works.I think I've covered all I know on this topic - hope it helps you.&#x200B;As above, if I wrote something that's incorrect, please let me know.Edit: formatting."

For example, my guess:myfile = fopen(\"file.txt\",\"r\")Now we Google it...ptr = fopen(\"fileopen\",\"mode\");So I guess I got lucky on that one. But ok, let's do a malloc.  I always forget that one. int* myIntArray;myIntArray = (int*)malloc(50*len(int))int *p1 = malloc(4*sizeof(int));Aha, there we go. I goofed up on the correct way to get the length in C.  No notes needed.  Just a quick Google. Now when I first started, I used to take notes for code like \"how to iterate a two d array\".  And would always have to refer to my notes when printing one out.  The problem is my notes were not helping me think logically.  Now I do it from scratch.  It's been like 2 years since I iterated a 2d array, but check this out (you'll have to take my word for it that I'm not cheating):(Assume my 2d array has data already and that I was given the length and width to save time)for(r=0,r<rows,r++){c=0; //(just in case lol)for (c= 0, c<columns,c++){printf(\"%d \",myArray[r][c]);}printf(\"\\n\");c=0;// (I'm really paranoid lol)}There's a small chance I may have an error in there, but point is that by not looking at notes, I was forced to think about the logic and can always visualize how to iterate the array. If I do have a mistake in there, I can easily fix it by seeing what's wrong and figuring out how to fix it (for example, out of bounds means I either swapped rows and columns (or am using r when I should be using c) or used <= when I should have used just a <, or I forgot to reset a variable (considering I have three resets for c, that shouldn't happen haha).  Or if I get an infinite loop, I forgot to put in a ++ somewhere or used an incorrect comparison (e.g. for (c=0;c<columns;r++) )"

I think it's best you first try to use your basic understanding of strings, tuples, dicts, lists, and functions to do all the above with zero youtube tutorials. I think its best if everyone learns how to start a project, sit back and think how you would want this done, plan it out, and start writing it piece by piece. If you get stuck, maybe think how you can manipulate all of the properties above, to get around the problem. I don't think cleanliness should be an issue (i.e. it doesn't matter if the code is ugly), what matters is you can get it to work, that you are able to use the knowledge you have acquired of the basics, to start up and write a project on your own. Then, you can post it here for feedback (i.e. how can I do this better). Or then start to look up how other people do it to see what portions you can improve your own code on"

I'm more of a learn/break it as your go. As another fellow beginner, you can start with at least print, input, while/if/for loops. Then for a longer and/or more complex game, branch out into functions, lists, f-strings and the random module (more ideas after examples below).Here's some examples to give you a rough idea for a basic game:For `input`, you could use it for:    adventurer = input('Hello, what is your adventurer's name? ')    # Now your adventurer has a name that the game can refer to like:        print(adventurer + ', watch out for that horse!')`while` for health (if you plan to have monsters). I used `while` but `if/elif/else` works too:    health = 50  # or whatever number you want starting health to be        while health > 0:        # code for the rest of the game here.    print('Game Over.')Choices with `if/else`:    choice = input('Would you like to take the left path? Y or N. ')        if choice.lower() == 'y'        # .lower() allows 'y' or 'Y' to be accepted            # Write what happens if adventurer go left here.        else:  # could also be written: elif choice.lower() == 'n'            # Write what happens if adventurer doesn't go left.The `random` module for:    import random        attack = random.randint(1, 5)    # Your attack will deal a random damage between 1-5 each time    # To make the game harder, write a seperate but slightly higher attack damage for enemiesI actually started one but haven't completed it yet (mix of laziness and lack of storyline). I recommend starting simple or you'll end up like me, sitting on the file. Here's what I kind of have in my imcompleted game:* dictionary (for player's inventory as enemies drop loot.)* pickle module (saves the game progress, or at least their inventory and stats upon exit)* time module (so there's a delay in loading text all at once depending on situation, see the link above for an example in use)There's a lot of different ways to write a text-based adventure game, this is just one way to do it. I'm sure there's a bunch of other modules out there you can keep adding to your game but imo you don't really need anything more than the built-in python stuff and the `random` module if you're just making something simple."

I’m essentially done with normal rounds working properly and am just now starting to implement special cases. It takes time, but the only way to learn is time. I found I don’t really like doing GUI stuff. It reminds me of early HTML (but that could also be because I chose to use tkinter). Just start watching videos on what you want to use."

The reason for using combinations\\_with\\_replacements for the brute force method is that you can decide, in the beginning, up to how many characters you want to guess. Then the method recursively iterates through all possible combinations starting from 1 character (It will go through a\\~Z and 0\\~9 if we are making combinations with only alphanumeric characters. Then \\[a\\~z or 0\\~9\\]+\\[a\\~Z or 0\\~9\\] and so on.). Once it iterates through the number of designated characters it will stop. I think you can also make it go on for infinity."

I’d also take a look at Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Both can have lots of Python involved and both areas are growing like crazy from a career development perspective. Tons of demand so developing skills and experience during college will prepare you to land an amazing job out of the gate. Take it from a 20+ year tech vet.  Never stop learning or building new skills.  Always try to ride the crest of the tech wave."

Then directly on github and pulling it down. Making some local and remote branches and merging them and syncing. Cloning to another computer or folder and syncing between the three of them etc. Cloning on github and working with multiple remotes. Making changes everywhere at once and fixing the merge conflicts. Once you got that down with a readme or just a few simple files you're far more equipped to handle git in the wild. It's actually great fun if you ever had to deal with people doing version control by sending zipped folder - far less trouble in the long run"

Use the command line, and write real simple scripts to this pattern,    $ python3 fix_formats.py original.cvs reformat.cvs    $ python3 drop_columns.py reformat.cvs droppedcols.cvsetc., where each script takes an input .cvs file name and an output file name.The point of this is to greatly simplify the programming task. Each script does just one thing, and you have its output file to inspect to make sure it did it right (or how it did it wrong). When it's all working you can use a shell script to run them all one after the other -- or at that point you can write a master python script to call the others. When that's working you can think about writing an interactive program using TKinter, which is a completely different job, but will be easy if you can depend on the previous parts being tested and working right."

That's how I heard about python so for me I always had a goal to automate stuff at work.That's why I always recommend for people working in an office environment to learn with ATBS and for those not working yet or not using a lot of data manipulation to use PCC to learn."

I didn't think I'd learn how to do some things.

I expanded the python scripts into an Object-Oriented suite; it formats the data the way it was, and created an additional CSV for reports; I even have it send an email. So, every week for that report all I had to do was run that script. And done."

I even pulled two all nighters for my midterm and I’m pretty sure I failed it. Not sure if this path was meant for me but I hear a little voice inside of me telling me that to keep going and another one telling me to switch my major however, I don’t want to give up on myself like this. I can’t really imagine myself doing anything else. Besides, One midterm shouldn’t bring me down if I enjoy writing programs in python that I want to program. Then as if God was telling me not to give up this notification pops up and quite frankly this made my day. I honestly thought I was the only one struggling with coding but I see every programmer has their ups and downs. So thank you!"

Back in the day, I was a Lotus Notes developer, and the company I worked for decided they didn't want to pay for the licenses any more.  They wanted to go another direction.  So, I did some research and decided that PHP would be a good choice.One problem: I didn't know PHP.  Now, at this point I had developed in many languages, and have had to learn on my feet.  I even had to learn tcl to do a project for PlanetFeedback.com.  That was a treat (ahem).  So... I started learning PHP.  I jumped onto a PHP forum (this was before reddit), and absorbed everything I could, while going through tutorials. Pretty soon, I was helping others with their problems.  We also did fun challenges, like \"write the song 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall in as few lines as possible.\"6 months after I began, I was approached by Wiley Publishing, and became a co-author of a PHP book!My advice: Don't think of it as learning, like school, where you have to study and worry about your lack of knowledge.  Look at it like a fun hobby, and don't just look for help here in the sub, but help others whenever you can.  As you have already figured out, it's *very* rewarding :)Great job, keep it up!Edit: Wanted to add, I'm a python noob myself.  As in, I decided to jump in yesterday.  I am a developer for the county I live in, and I may have some need to do python projects in the future.  So... here I go again.  I'm excited for the future!  Look for my book in a year or so LMAO"

According to her contract, she is to be paid for all hours worked but they were stiffing her and all the other teachers for recess duty and lunch duty (15min a pop). When a grievance was filed, they said “you can manually submit your timesheets for the hours worked”. Any sheet that was incorrect would not payout. And there was a deadline of 2 days on top of regular teaching responsibilities. They gave them a blank pdf that only covered 5 days of a pay period but wanted to account for that too so every 2 sheets had the same pay period. It also had to account for grading period too so you couldn’t just print off a bunch of sheets with the majority of info filled in already. I had her put together a spreadsheet with her times per day(didn’t have duty every day because of holidays, assemblies, and closings) and made a script to took the template pdf and filled it in accordingly. Saved a few hours of printing these out and filling in the sheets accurately. And more importantly, she got the money that was owed her... ~$800.P.S. I have another story about a 2-3rd? grade student who was given a dumb assignment by her math teacher. “Write all the numbers from 1-1000”. That’s it. There is no lesson in that; it’s just tedious busy work.Anyway, her mom is a mathematician and pythonista so she had her make a loop program to write all the numbers and print it out to paper. I suggested she should have put a “typo” in it to challenge the teacher to actually grade it if she was going to make the kids do that punishment of an assignment."

So she could specify the folder of the images and then specify the output or if she doesn't just make your own, and then let her click a bar. Maybe add a loading bar. That would look nice :) Good job helping someone you care about with something that you enjoy! I also had the honor to build an app for my mother's job as well. It does really feel satisfying knowing that her 2 hours of work can be done in 2 minutes with Python.Good luck on your next projects!"

The smallest changes can make a world of difference when it comes to speed of a program.And B. Look at websites such as Spotify, Apple (although overdone), and other sites such as even Java (I think, while it has a simple design, it looks nice), to restyle your program a bit!Know there's always room for improvement, but keep on building!

I've been recommending the book to all of my friends so I'll recommend the course too. Thank you!Another thing. I'm not sure this is the right place, but since I'm already here... In the Input Validation chapter in ATBS2, specifically in the Multiplication Quiz Project, you start using \"%s\" and this, as far as I can tell, had not been introduced yet. This made me very confused and I felt like I had missed something big. It was easy enough to learn about it from Google, but it would be nice to have a heads up or something.Anyway, the book is awesome!"

Still after him to follow through. I found both the book (which I also bought) and video course enormously helpful in breaking past the usual theoretical approach of most python beginner classes. I come from a sysadmin background where we mostly did shell and perl programming. Al's was the first approach that really motivated me to make python my go-to language."

Its been a month and I don't know where my direction is? Still there trying to master functions, list, tuples and all, still afraid of inheritance and OOP, all the courage I have is to go to w3schools and practice all the new syntax. I have completed the python for dummies book until it got to AI and neural networks stuff. Most of the specified code  during these topics, didn't run and I found no solution on stackoverflow or google that I can understand and apply. That's where my mind started going bonkers. I don't have any outlet for this kind of stuff building up in my head. Neither do I have any place like you where I can actually apply what I learn. But let's be honest here, I haven't learn enough to apply on anything.I would really appreciate a suggestion on what to do next.My goal is to get into Data Science/Data Analysis. That's the reason I started learning python a month ago. Prior to that, I had no known knowledge on programming. I know I need to learn SQL next, but I can't make myself ready until I feel I confident in programing. I am open for anything free, but courses like udacity and coursera are like way out of my budget."

As a beginner it is perfect to start with simple things to progress into more advanced things. Perhaps after a while they need to check stuff inside the files and based on the content and/or filenames they should be moved to different directories and they perhaps want a pretty looking logfile that truncates itself so it does not become huge.Then they have learned quite a few useful features, step by step.Batch files are not that much of an advantage anyway. Sure, using dir is faster than running a script in python but i doubt this operation is in that much of a hurry anyway. 10 seconds vs 2 seconds might not matter that much in that situation."

These two sentences here are the problem! I found it really hard to learn when I was just trying to learn syntax, and never felt I knew enough to do anything. What helped me was to try to think of a task that I could do to practice using the syntax, for example I wrote a script that pulled my steam library and worked out cost per hour played (I have made some poor purchasing decisions but that's another story). Did this take longer than doing it manually? Absolutely. Did it involve lots of Googling to try to work out how regexes work? Sure did. Did I need to do this for work? Goodness me no.I think what I'd recommend, and I'm not an expert on this so feel free to ignore, is:1. Take a break - you sound fed up and as if you are treating this as a chore. It shouldn't be, it should be fun. It's ok to have a day off and come back when you want to learn.2. Think of anything you could automate - want to check the weather in your local area? Check Apple's share price? Play rock, paper, scissors against your computer? All of these are things that I almost guarantee you have the knowledge to do, you just need a lot of Googling and...3. Break things into small pieces - you can't write the whole programme in one sitting, so break it down into smaller bits. In effect you might have a tiny bit of code to copy some text, another bit to paste it, another bit to add a set phrase to the end of the text, etc. Breaking the code down makes it much more approachable and feel more achievable, and you will have learnt enough to do these small things, even if you don't feel you've learnt enough for the whole project."

Can you find a way to pull all of your transaction data, put it into a data frame, and then do some analysis on it like categorizing, visualizing, etc? I don’t know how to do databases but I have a lot of work data from old ass apps with no APIs (I’m in healthcare), so I use pandas and an excel sheet like a poor mans database Basically it looks like:Export shitty unclean data from my work medical records Clean up the data (replacing weird symbols, spaces, getting all the date time in the same format, etc) Convert excel sheet into a pandas data frameDo data analysis.  And then saving back to an excel spreadsheet using xlsxwriter I’m certain that this is a terrible way to do what I’m trying to do, but it works! So, whatevs lol.  I asked my friend who is more advanced in data science than me when should I start learning databases instead of my excel spreadsheet database, and he said, “meh, if it works for you keep doing it. When it stops working then you’ll know it’s time to change”I suspect that my method will stop working when the rows in the data frame get into the millions?Anyway, another idea if you don’t want to do budget is to do fantasy football analysis.  There are some good websites that have APIs, so you can learn how to make those in addition to the data science tools like pandas, etc.  TL;DR learning is much easier when you have a specific project in mindP.s.  I took a traditional online community college course for Python and Corey Schafers YouTube series is in the exact order of my schools modules for object oriented programming in Python So if you want a traditional track you can literally just go through this videos in orders and you’ve got it!"

The opposite - where their teacher just automatically knows everything and spits out cool library code off the top of their head - likely gets portrayed way too much in the name of teachers looking cool, while discouraging students wondering how they're supposed to attain that magic."

I got it at a discount but it was a very good course and Jose teaches the basics very well.Then I subscribed to this subreddit and a lot of the posts suggest reading \"Automate the Boring stuff with Python\" Which is a very good book to learn the basics as well.But at the time I had more or less decent grasp of the basics of Python already so I skipped to the later chapters that involved automation of common tasks in the work place (particularly, the chapter about excel)Afterwards I found this course: [https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)The course is a bit technical but it helps you to think programmatically, its also free!edit: I forgot to mention that the EDX course was highly suggested by people on this subreddit as well. I didn't actually find it, so much as this subreddit recommended it to me as well. So thank you again for that!Edit: Keep in mind that the way I learned won't be the same for everyone else nor is it the most efficient way to learn Python. so lurk around this subreddit and ask questions on the weekly thread. you may find someone has found a way to learn Python that works better for you, Happy Learning!Hope this helps!"

Most courses show you the CSV module or how to code a read CSV function before teaching you an improved workflow using Pandas for data science tasks. I think that your point is valid, but some people are interested in learning Python for data science and may want to jump in to that quickly. Even using the CSV module versus coding the function yourself is an abstraction.I do not think that one way is necessarily better for learning Python, but this is a great point for discussion and I’m interested to hear other opinions on this."

It's like using excel but with extra steps.**Developers** SHOULD learn how to do raw Python or any raw language they need to use before diving into frameworks and libraries (to an extent). You shouldn't be using a robust library all together if your script is very simple, but that is part of optimization and architecture.**Data Scientists** will treat it as a tool, you use this and than and bam, you have results.

Developers may or may not have some background in another language, and are looking to make efficient applications. Learning the details will help then do just that. Data Scientists on the other hand mostly certainly already had some experience with other ways to manipulate data like excel. If you make simple tasks in excel too difficult in python, it will likely make then quit. Besides, the example already make them familiar with the dataframe object. It's very likely that 95% of their time they will spend manipulating dataframes. If you are worried that we are teaching the dataframe object too soon, get a R studio tutorial and look how long it takes for then to teach DataFrames. A Data Scientist have similar needs."

It helped a lot that I knew classes by the time so I kinda knew what pandas was doing under water. Also it gave me a very good foundation in pythonic programming. But on the other hand, learning pandas would have saved me a lot of time in the beginning and I'd learned the details about the rest anyway.I think it depends on what one needs. If a student will use Python for one course and needs to get started quickly, pandas is a very good tool. For somebody who wants to be a developer or use Python for much longer, your approach might be of more use."

Yeah concepts like imports, loops, assignments, etc. are a given. That is entry-level knowledge and can be learned in 5 minutes on Youtube. But just use the available tools if they have already been created. There is no practical need to learn things that are outside the scope of the problem you are trying to solve. Especially when it comes to Python which is already high level as it is, just use the libraries for christ sake. That is why the tools were created in the first place, not everyone needs to be a developer.If you want to be an actual developer at the enterprise level then Python contains only a subset of applications you will be using it for anyways. Don't reinvent them because chances are some developer has already has done that and then some. There are far more practical uses for your time unless you really want to become a developer yourself. And if you do want to become a dev, I wouldn't recommend Python as a first language anyhow. You will miss out on a lot because it is too simple and limited. In that case forget Python and start with C++ or Java."

We all accept some level of abstraction that we do not need to code ourselves.When I switch between frontend/backend work with c#/.net/typescript and datascience with python, I greatly appreciate the abstractions of the pandas library.  I don’t need to focus on the low level tasks, and I can focus more on understanding the data and the modeling.And when learning pandas/np/scikitlearn, it was the abstractions like read_csv, that allowed me to learn the overall process of reading, exploring, cleaning data, without getting lost in the lower level coding.   I could spend more time trying to understand the theory behind the algorithms, instead of spreading limited time over the more mundane."

Let along pandas, even a simple generic Python line like a = list(), I bet most don’t know what happens in the process and don’t intend to find out. Then of what difference could it there be from constructing a table. In the end, They are both objects that store data, what else should we know about it beside using it. Also Keep in mind this process into knowing the fundamentals require long time and proper training to almost fully understand. Meanwhile, if people want to utilize Python for things they want to do with before they master the language, go for it. That is the original intention of Python. It welcomes everyone."

Python is a programming language with a huge standard library, and the number of users who have no idea of the workings of the Python Data Model is astounding. Pandas is itself a huge library, basically a framework for data wrangling and while it’s extremely useful it has its shortcomings. Unfortunately people rarely distinguish the two, especially Data Scientists, which is why we end up with DataFrames everywhere and bloated environments. Most unfortunate is the fact that not only does a good understanding of the Python language lead to better programs but also more efficient code - even when using pandas."

No matter what you can't get away from these fundamentals of programming and understanding them from the outset will only help on your journey. As people who are trying to teach others python, I think it's important to keep in mind that larger view.If you were helping someone learn to play guitar, for example, do you encourage them to start with a 9 string guitar and learn advanced tapping / sweeping techniques? No, you start them with a 6 string and give them basic chord shapes. Because even if they learn the advanced stuff up front, there will always be a fundamental piece of it that will need to learn and understand in order to truly \"get\" it, and if they do learn it early, they will see the patterns they initially understood over and over again throughout the learning process. BB King and James Hetfield play all the same notes and learned the same basic chords, even though the end goals are wildly different."

(I'm no musician, but hopefully you get my point.)Fundamentally, there's some that view programming as a tradecraft that should be deeply understood as a language. They're going to BE a \"python developer\" (among other things of course.) That's fine. Understanding the use of csv is a great precursor to using pandas. These folks are focused on developing their python skills.OTOH, there are a significant number of casual(?) python users who just need to get something else done. They don't need to understand overloading or \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_ constructs. They need to get the data analyzed by tomorrow morning. These folks are focused on delivering specific results.I'm not suggesting pandas is inherently better than the csv approach. I'm just saying there seems to be a larger percentage of people using python (compared to other languages) who don't really want or need to be python developers. It's a tool to get a job done so they can move on to the next problem.BTW: I appreciate your thoughtful post. This is a good thread."

A programming language is just a tool to be used to accomplish a task. In Data Science you'll work with a combination of R, Python and at least one variant of SQL. Rolling out your own solution to read `.csv` files as beginner isn't a productive use of time when your goal is to understand how to build a GLM, what it does and it's limitations at one of many topics. The concepts alone are difficult enough and programming is just a  part of Data Science (Statistics > High level OOP language > Database language > Tableau/Some other BI software > Lower level programming) spending 2 days trying to write a `.csv` parser just for the sake of it is a waste of time. Why do you suggest using the `csv` module instead of writing their own version, or why use Python instead of C? Or rolling out their own plotting library using `pillow` instead of using `matplotlib`/`bokeh`/`plotly`?Your ideas about missing out on learning language fundamentals are very far off the mark. In your OP you mention a bunch of stuff like learning how to import modules, using for loop, assigning a variable etc. as reasons to use the `csv` module of `pandas` most of the points apply equally to pandas. And nobody's goal is to simply import a `.csv`, that's just the first step in doing some sort of data manipulation and analysis which is literally impossible to do with using the 'fundamentals' of programming."

They get it working, and that's that.3) their professors aren't reviewing the code for cleanliness and might not have the best idea of what clean code might look like in general4) the goal is to produce results, not write clean code. Hacking something together is perfectly fine. They don't need to maintain this stuff for years. They aren't usually writing a library for others to use.I think number 4 is the main issue. If you just need results, you just need results. Who cares if it's messy if it works? Even coming from a comp sci background I think this is fine. The goal doesn't always have to be code you need to maintain forever, and I think we get distracted with cleaning up code and writing clean code for the sake of it, when it isn't always a big deal.If I just need a few numbers I'm going to write a quick and dirty script, not some library I can package and upload to pypi."

If you are interested in it for data science purposes and not aware of pandas as a beginner, it's possible to do everything via ugly and slow low-level data handling and hamper yourself because you don't know the standard tools. I don't think there's anything wrong with getting to know the low-level and high-level libraries together.EDIT: I do agree that there's an issue of context here. Many beginners don't have need for pandas. DataFrames really shine for well-structured tabular data. The low-level stuff should be presented to beginners unless it's clearly the right use-case."

I've haven't dived into 1.0 much yet, but my understanding is that it fixed a bunch of stuff and it's probably worth it to learn on that. Most things are the same across the versions."

What I decided to do was to teach how to query from the DB (with a custom one-liner from an in-house package), how to set the arguments in pivot\\_table and how to put it to Excel. She would have bored to death if I started lecturing her that she needs to know how with statement works, how packaging works in Python and the meaning of all the computery quiz words before she could understand this 3 lines of high-level code. Many of those learning Python wants to get productive fast and automate simple boring stuff, like my colleague, not necessarily to have the title \"programmer\".&#x200B;Sorry for the rant. I also like the discussion and your opinions though I respectfully disagree. Pandas is useful also for non-programmers."

                "comment": "To be honest there's a level of difference in the task as well. Coding in data science and other specific fields is more likely to be the task of writing something conceptually complex that has to run correctly once or a handful of times. Whereas software design professionals are trying to write simple (ie maintainable, where complexity is either deliberately ignored or excised from the main system) code that runs constantly. So \"just trying to get something done\" means different things with that dichotomy as well, which for a professional software engineer might mean doing an SQL dump for a data analyst to figure out while they spend time on code. Ultimately choosing the right tool for the job is a huge part of the job and that comes with experience. For beginners they probably need to understand how to work with json more than with CSV because the object model is closer to useful python concepts. At that point a list of tuples is be enough to get the concepts across, and depending on the domain the level up might be pandas, but it might alternately be numpy, or sqlite, or spatial libraries it graphics libraries."

From the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html):>The Python and NumPy indexing operators \\[\\] and attribute operator . provide quick and easy access to pandas data structures across a wide range of use cases. This makes interactive work intuitive, as there’s little new to learn if you already know how to deal with Python dictionaries and NumPy arrays. However, since the type of the data to be accessed isn’t known in advance, directly using standard operators has some optimization limits. For production code, we recommended that you take advantage of the optimized pandas data access methods exposed in this chapter.I guess it pays off to actually read the documentation :). That said, all code you see posted around the net is using the (inferior) \\[-operator. So that's the code you end up with when collaborating with others. Oh well, that's my rant. I've learned something new. Thank's for the input."

Just writing setup.py and requirements is more than enough for our packages and is really easy to do. Perhaps it becomes more difficult if your req is 100 lines long... but that seems like a different problem :)"

Both are great at accomplishing your tasks 10 times faster than your archaic colleagues can."

If you want to be a programmer for a living, certainly tell your boss. When they push more work on your plate and expect you to perform without any pay increase, be ready to walk, there's a better job awaiting you anyways. They will almost always offer you more before letting that happen, retraining someone costs them time and money, you are far more valuable to them then they will initially let on. If you don't want to program for a living, and really just value your free time and not being micro managed, hacking in secrecy might be perfect for you...but unless your job is absolutely awesome, it would seem from the outside like you're selling yourself short"

Still others might say, develop the program further so we can get rid of OPs coworker who did it as directed for years but would make the manager look great by laying off. There are scores of people and companies in the latter two examples. OP should probably get his Github ready and maybe even have an offer ready before sharing any of this in case things go bad. I might sound paranoid, but I created a very simple automation and it cost two people their jobs. And one drank herself to death shortly after."

I'm guessing it worked for you, but I guess that's by luck? Did you have any trouble with this?  Usually I would expect someone to use an interfacing library of some kind.(Note, if you just made a plain-text file called .docx and then wrote into it, and then had Word open it and THEN save it as a proper doxc I image this would work fine.)"

SHOCKED to find out that I couldn't do it without a significant effort. They were thinking I could do it in a 1-2 hours every week in my spare time.From their reaction, they didn't believe me and told me to talk to the senior statistician to make sure I was understanding what I was refusing to do and the opportunity I was missing by not helping.The statistician has my back and thought it was equally absurd, but I'm sure right now they are double checking with other programmers because they don't trust my answer."

My boss, a woman with permanent PMS, hires someone to do just that sort of thing then comes in an asks me to help accounting out by writing a small program for them.  I asked her if she didn't just hire a guy to do that sort of thing.  She didn't say a word, turned and (probably) ran to HR where she wrote me up for insubordination.  I was suspended with pay for 3-4 months and then fired.  I was 1 year away from retirement after 20 years with the company.  My reviews were always close to perfect for twenty years. My lawyer got me rehired and I was suspended for about 9 months more with pay and was paid what they called severance and allowed to retire.  I needed 21 years service for full retirement.  Funny thing was that I never told her I wouldn't help accounting.  I was just joking around.  She was fired 6 months later and her boss was transferred to the company's equivalent of Outer Mongolia about 9 months later and never heard from again I understand.  Our company newsletter had a Retirees Section and I sent a picture of me at the wheel of the nice RV I bought with the severance money along with a story of all the wonderful places we had been to since retiring.  I imagine what my boss thought of that."

Prompting for input implies your program is \"interactive\", but this program isn't really. It doesn't \"need\" the user to run and its output is to a file. Also, it requires you to first invoke it over the command line, and then type some stuff in, rather than typing it all in at once, leveraging your shells tab completion for files names.I.e. it's a \"batch process\" and should be treated as suchOf course, for a 30 line script that'll be used once it doesn't matter. I was really hoping the OP would say they don't know how command line arguments work, and I could link them to something. Or that they aren't using the command line at all as they're scared of it, and were double clicking the file in Windows Explorer, or something. Again I could talk them out of that and into the power of the shell :)Ps For your sake, know that argparse is often overkill for such a small script. Just read sys.argv directly."

Dragging and dropping things about?Or do everything in your IDE and hope it has every function you need?As far as I'm concerned a shell is *the* way to interact with a POSIX or Windows computer system. The reason for that is these computer systems are made up of processes on a filesystem, and processes do useful things. A shell allows you  to invoke the exact process you want with the exact parameters you want, and is often design around facilitating that, e.g. tab completion and glob expansion. Your operating system already comes with a large suite of useful utilities, and it's trivially easy to add more. E.f. if I want to check a files integrity I'd use `md5sum myfile.txt`. The GUI alternative would be to download some random app of source forge, hope I don't get a virus, and then click a bunch of buttons.Unless you mean \"why do people write bash scripts rather than python?\" And the answer is usually compatibility and/or brain damage."

I just watched a few hours worth of tutorials, got really confused, quit for a bit, restarted etc. From rewatching the same tutorials over and over again, the logic behind programming is more so naturally ingrained into me. As for with udemy courses, I'm working alongside them (writing notes on online videos is a first, but cool) and experimenting. So far, since I started yesterday, I'm only up to half way through linux commands, but at least I know all the logic behind the maths of subnetting... ^(not that I'll ever need it when there are calculators.)I remember reading before (on this subreddit) that you don't know a programming language until you understand what it's good for and what it isn't. Is there anyway to actually do this outside of experience? Languages have lots of modules that makes lots of things viable (e.g. python, pygame is supposedly one of the only viable game-making modules, whereas I've used tkinter, which is more so leaning towards old-GUI, and still have it look decent)."

They are good, and the difficulty scales pretty well - mostlhy.But problem 5 is a lot harder than the others, because web scraping is a dark art.  You have to use something like the requests library, and a lot of site owners restrict web scraping.  Then the code you get is often really messy, so you end up needing something like beautiful soup to make it more manageable.So I'd make it easier like this:* Find a web page that interests you.* Use ctrl-u to view the source code of that page* copy the page's code and paste it in a text editor* save the code to a local file* write your program to read the codeThis solution manually downloads the page code so you can get to the content you want (even through menus and other stuff) then work with it.But you still have the complexity of HTML as a data source.  You might think about learning how to use the beautiful soup library to grab specific elements you are interested in working with.I have a video on this (and reading APIs) that I can make available if people want it."

Try downloading counties for a selected set of states instead of all of them to make it a little harder.3. Reorganize your pictures by renaming them based on the date the picture was taken.4. Download some COVID data in a spreadsheet and do some calculations like average number of cases over a 7-day period, find the highest number of cases in a day, or calculate the number of cases per 100,000 people.

Every time I see (almost) *any* code that uses `input()`, I immediately know the coder is a beginner. There are essentially no real world use cases for `input()`, yet this is a common exercise for beginners for some reason.  I find it far more helpful to show beginners how to use `sys.argv` to pass in arguments, and then introduce `optparse` as soon as possible.  Other than prompting for a password, no serious command line program uses an interactive input prompt (you use arguments, switches, or read from a file), and you certainly would not use `input()` with a GUI either. So why does everyone love `input()` for beginners' exercises?"

As a Python beginner, I'd suggest focusing on fully understanding the concepts and practicing projects that require less than 20 lines of code. You can start with implementing common Python library functions, like add(), sub(), swap(), max(), min(), strings replace(), find(), reverse() and so on.Once you complete Python 201 or more advanced lessons, you can try to work on projects solving real world problems as mentioned at bullet 5. My suggestion for young kids is to work on game projects like writing tic-tac-toe, connect four etc.I will share more course materials and project ideas on the Web site and in our [Kids Python YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VGmSaLz-WGwyeWk7kyebA).

I shouldn't have rained on the OP's parade.I guess my point was you just don't see input() out in the wild except in a couple instances, but for some reason that's the first thing we have a beginner do. It's weird to me.  Take almost any command line program, say grep, ssh, cat, pandoc, or gcc, and you won't see an input() type of situation except for password entry and usually some sort of confirmation (\"Are you sure? Yes/No\"). I spend enormous amounts of time living on the command line, and personally I find it a rare use case. Not that it doesn't happen, but it is the exception to what is considered good practice for normal user interfaces.  It is almost always better (except for the cases I just mentioned) to pass the info into the program through arguments, switches, and files.  I suppose I was reacting to this recommendation because I think input() shouldn't be taught as a \"normal\" way to interact with programs. New programmers will use it in places that don't make sense, and more experienced ones will move on to better methods (namely arguments, switches, and files)."

Now how is that done in a Pythonic way?\" will push you to research on Google and teach you real-world approaches to developing a program. Just my 2-cents. Happy coding!"

I feel as though I need things explained in a very non-maths way to get my brain to ‘click’ and have it sink in. I’ve gone over stuff again and again and not ‘got’ it, but I am starting to get there now.My plan is to start Space Invaders in the back of my book to get some hands-on coding, and refer back to the appropriate section as needed. I also have vague plans for a text-based adventure game, I just have to figure out the best way of joining many overworld sections together! So far I’m looking at classes, it’s just the specific setup I need to work on. Wish me luck!"

I'm thankful because one of the tutors is really good and they always walk me through any python trouble I have. I'm almost done with my first course and I feel like I probably would have benefited more from python learning this in an in person environment. I bought a couple of python books as references in the future as I want to get a job in coding."

It took me a while to stick with a resource that suits my learning best and I its going to be a very long process but I am determined. I spend about 1/2 hours a night. I haven't written any of my own code as such yet, just figuring out and remembering all the different processes. I do wish I started earlier but I suppose now I'm older I also have that little bit more patients and try to be thorough. Great post by the way, motivation is key to learning."

Okay, so I worked as HR profession so I am quite capable of advance excel function. I have some basic knowledge of html. but when come to Python, the \"coding sentence\" (don't know what they really called it) is just confusing. sometimes the command is put to the front, sometimes at the back. sometimes we need to '.'  and sometimes it just need a space. Seem like there's no logic in coming up with the language (at least, to my beginner self) Especially in Loops, I just so confused that I have to write it down and take it apart in each element and then compare it to the example. Totally took me one hour to understand it but in real time, it's like a week of watching lesson. doing exercise. fail. try again. search internet but more confused. etc.&#x200B;so , what is your more memorable story?"

I’m currently learning Common Lisp and C++. Languages I have learned and still learning are Python, C, racket, SML, Rust, and a little Ruby (enough to hate it). Right now, my biggest hurdle is learning all the math I should’ve learned 20 years ago so I can learn algorithms. I don’t think age gets in the way except that I have more responsibilities that I didn’t have when I was younger, so it is harder to advance when juggling a job and family. The biggest annoyance is reading questions like, “Is 22 too old to get started in programming?” The way I see it, I have 25 years left to work, so what’s 3-5 years to gain new skills and enjoy 20 years in a more challenging and rewarding career?"

I am finding the hardest part is finding projects that are both feasible and engaging. I wrote my first program and accomplished a huge automation win for some security scanning I was mostly doing manually, and that felt great. It still needs a tweak or two to format the report a little more cleanly, but as I am getting near the end of the project, I am concerned I will not have enough things to practice with to keep me interested.The book I am reading and most online training courses have you build programs that essentially do nothing; alien shooter games and whatnot. I find I have a hard time finishing those if the end-goal is not something I care about like shooting at fake aliens as opposed to solving specific challenges I have as an admin that cannot be solved by more simple means."

Since strings are immutable, A + B + C takes two strings of lengths a/b and produces a new string of length a+b, then takes that new string and a string of length c and produces a fifth string of length a+b+c, etc. etc. So, if you have a lot of strings/variables concatenated together, this approach wastes a ton of time creating temporary new strings and copying them over and over.Also, f-strings always formats data to strings properly. Adding stuff to a string may have weird results depending on how the operator is defined for the thing you're trying to write."

None of this is impossible with printing but it's \\*so\\* much more involved to do so.Print debugging is a good first step, especially as a gateway for new programmers starting to inspect their code, but it's really not a replacement for a real debugger."

Started programming with Python a few months ago, and I was unpleasantly suprised by the enviroment of Stack Overflow at first...sometimes it felt the quality of the question is more important than the question itself, as I noted that after a few questions, my votes got some downvotes.Now I notice I do take more time and effort to find answers myself, which is one of the advantages of their system imo. And so far, I always managed to find my answer. I also understand it makes it easier for other people to actually find an answer to the questions they need, as it would be a lot harder to find those with an overload of 'bad questions'.&#x200B;Nonetheless, I do really miss an enviroment where I also am free to ask  more 'stupid' questions without the need of thinking too much about the quality of the question. Hopefully, here is the right place for that :)"

Even if the sub is for learning some of them still wont tolerate behinner questions it seems. They will just ban you instantly no second chances. On stack they give you more chances but people still down vote your question regardless of how well you ask it sometimes just because your a beginner."

They have a lot of clear, sensible rules, and yet most of the  posts blatantly ignore those rules.Stack Overflow is very much not intended to be a place for beginners to ask the same questions over and over again, but a place for people to ask advanced, tricky questions that cannot be solved anywhere else.I stopped contributing to Stack Overflow, not because they were \"disgusting\" but because I got burnt out dealing with the endless, repetitive beginner questions - questions that generally already had answers - and if you point out to poster that an answer already exists, you generally get abuse.Don't get me wrong.  I spend a few hours a week on this subreddit helping people, even total beginners, but I _expect_ to get beginner questions here.The reason that Stack Overflow has value is because of those \"disgusting\" users.  I hate to be blunt, but if it were up to beginners, Stack Overflow would be worthless."

Stackoverflow is not meant to be a learning resource, it is a maintained repository of programming related questions and answers. Good stackoverflow questions are designed to be a resource for future searchers and most beginners are not able to write questions that fulfill that purpose.If you want to read more about this topic, I suggest this blog post: https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/"

Honestly, I don't ask questions on SO anymore. I just search it for the answers already there. If I can't find an answer, I just go back to the docs. I'll *answer* questions, but it's rarely worth asking a question. Perhaps that's because all the low hanging fruit have been answered so it's becoming harder and harder to ask a new, unique question."

But I never found a book that talked about these classic ciphers that also covered how to break them and how to write programs that implement and break them. The book assumes no coding experience, so if you're interested in simple ciphers (and why we don't use them anymore in the age of computers) it's a pretty good book."

Sometimes you just need a quick way to make a program loop and get live, non-\"input\" keyboard input or find a relationship between rectangles on a 2D plane.The amount of built-in modules in a vanilla python install is staggering. Also, it's really worth exploring sample scripts, both in the built-in modules and in third-party modules."

You need to actually apply that learning and start practicing that new concept right away. When I did this, I was feeling frustrated every single time. It’s like I could follow the examples in the video, and the minute I went off and tried something on my own, I was totally lost… and then I became frustrated. But in fact, that’s what learning feels like sometimes, that is your cue that you are stepping outside your comfort zone and venturing off and telling your brain that this is something new that you want to learn. It can feel shitty and frustrating … many times actually. But the key is to keep at it again and again. If you try and fail, and fail many times, and unable to debug your code, and research your error and you still can’t figure it out, then congratulation, because that IS LEARNING (you’re trying!). But if you don’t try at all because you are afraid to confront that, well I’m sorry that’s not learning because you are afraid you won’t be able to solve the challenge. Don’t have the mindset that you NEED to solve the problem, but simply attempt to solve it and work your best to understanding your code. Even if you fail over and over, that’s fine because you are doing your best, and that’s what matters for your learning. Don’t worry about getting the problem right, worry about understanding why you are getting it wrong."

If LOGO had proper commercial support and interest, I'd love to work in it as well! :-)"

If the tutorials don't click, I would suggest spending time to find a way to apply it to your own needs. Maybe simple backup scripts or just play around with text. Also, what really pushed my learning curve was to just dive in head first into more advanced projects. A lot of times that helped me solidify my understanding of more basic concepts. And really, just keep doing it because mastery is fundamentally dependent on the amount of time you've spent."

Every debugger I have ever run was built into the IDE I was using (actually that’s not technically true but it should be for you), where IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. PyCharm is so good it’s basically its own programming language on top of Python. VSCode has extensions that can make it good if you’re lucky. Make sure you get one that’s Python compatible, and don’t worry about multiple language support on an IDE until switching apps is the biggest problem you have when multi-language coding. Of course, if you give up every time you get confused, you won’t get anywhere. You HAVE to struggle in front of your screen until you are its willing master."

Once you get into something like that, then you can come here and ask more targeted specific questions and get the help you need. You could also sign up for leetcode.com and try working on some of their easy problems. If you find the \"easy\" ones too difficult don't get discouraged you're just starting so it's understandable."

                "comment": "And here's a little roadmap for people who are new or want to continue learning before doing any projects## Road-mapHere's a Python road-map to take you from complete beginner to advanced with machine learning. I don't know what area of computer science you're interested in (AI, web dev, etc.) but I'd say do everything up to intermediate and then branch off. You'll need everything up to intermediate to have any chance of passing a tech interview if you want to do this as a career. Hopefully, this provides some framework for you to get started on:## Beginner* Data Types - Lists, Strings, Tuples, Sets, Floats, Ints, Booleans, Dictionaries* Control Flow/Looping - for loops, while loops, if/elif/else* Arithmetic and expressions* I/O (Input/Output) - Sys module, Standard input/output, reading/writing files  * Functions* Exceptions and Error Handling* Basics of object oriented programming (OOP) (Simple classes).## Intermediate* Recursion* More advanced OOP - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Method overloading.* Data Structures - Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees, Hash Maps* Algorithms - Linear Search, Binary Search, Hashing, Quicksort, Insertion/Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, Depth First Search, Breathe First Search, Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm.* Algorithmic Complexity## Advanced - A.I. / Machine Learning/ Data science* Statistics* Probability* Brute Force search* Heuristic search (Manhattan Distance, Admissible and Informed Heuristics)* Hill Climbing* Simulated Annealing* A\\* search* Adversarial Search (Minimax & Alpha-Beta pruning)* Greedy Algorithms* Dynamic Programming* Genetic Algorithms* Artificial Neural Networks* Backpropagation* Natural Language Processing* Convolutional Neural Networks* Recurrent Neural Networks* Generative Adversarial Networks## Advanced - Full stack web development* Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)* Backend web dev tools (flask, django) (This is for app logic, interfacing with databases etc).* Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend) (Angular 6+, React/Redux)* With frontend you'll also need - HTML, CSS, Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is using in angular. It makes writing javascript nicer).* Relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)* Non-relational (MongoDB)* Cloud computing knowledge is good, (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)## Resources### Books* Automate the boring stuff* Algorithms and Data structures in Python by Goldwasser (Intermediate level)* Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science* Slither into Python: An Introduction to the Python programming language* Fluent Python - Clear, Concise, and Effective ProgrammingHere's some ones for other related and important topics:* Clean Code by Robert Martin (How to write good code)* The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt (General software engineering / best practices)* Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (Networks, useful depending on the field you're entering, anything internet based this stuff will be important)* The Linux Command Line, 2nd Edition (Install the Linux operating system and get used to using the command line, it'll be your best friend).* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach### Online courses:I am not a fan of youtube for learning as you're just being hand-fed code and not being given any exercises to practice with so I won't be linking youtube video series here. In fact I'm not a fan of video courses in general but these two are good.* Udemy - Complete Python Masterclass (This is for beginners stage).* Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Advanced - A.I.)Most importantly, practice, practice, practice. You won't get anywhere just watching videos of others programming. Try dedicate an hour a day or 2 hours a day on the weekend if you can."

It takes me longer, but it's been a great learning experience.I will say, learning to think differently has been the biggest challenge.  When I should use which type of loops for example.

This just gives them a basic idea about what are the bare minimum things possible with python also, there are many beginners who literally do not know what to do after they finish a beginner python course which at the end demotivates them and they entirely leave programming. Doing these as I said, \"will give you guys a massive skill, knowledge and a confidence boost in python\". By the way, I never said it is compulsory but doing them will surely help."

For all the challenges there were quite a few \"Aha!\" moments that made it worth it. That being said, I did devote a fairly sizable chunk of time each week (maybe ten hours) to get through it and understand everything. So I would say just make sure you have enough time to get through it. I didn't use any books or anything, just googled around when I needed clarification or help."

There are certainly third party sites that do this, however directing someone away from your publications can lead to lost sales.You've put a lot of work into the book and you can maximize your visibility with this sort of option as we all want instant gratification these days.You may have already done this, although if so I couldn't find an easy to access link to do so. Also, github is sort of a place for people who already know some of this stuff, I skimmed the first few pages of text and it seems you are writing towards a more advanced user. If that is your intent then that is great. I'm a haphazard programmer who tries to use the easiest tool (for me) available. PHP, javascript for web stuff, C for embedded, and Python for everything else. I go to stackoverflow for most of my immediate questions, especially regex. I'll install Pandas before thinking to hard about regex to sift data.I guess what I am trying to say is your book might be too in-depth for many people. Maybe you would consider adding a 'beginner's tutorial' that later references your more advanced material?Tie that into your website and you've got your self a winner.Regardless, thanks for making your ebook free!"

                "comment": "Took a quick glance through it, and I'd argue its actually just the right level of depth for beginner users, and the more adept user. It has all the basics, and later on, goes into some of the more advanced/extensive uses you can have with regex (and additional reading for anyone who wants more advanced uses).   However, there isn't quite an introduction. The book is partitioned less like a book, and more like documentation (i.e. here is first regex function, lets break down this function, then next function, etc.). If people are looking at this with no knowledge of regex, they are immediately thrown into a rabbit hole of different uses of regex, without understanding why they'd need it in the first place or what it can do. I'd recommend adding a brief introduction, i.e. regex is this, and it can do something like this. If you take:  [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\\_regex.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp)  as an example, right off the bat you can see a very simple straightforward breakdown, and some very basic demonstrations of regex right off the bat (without going into any detail,ignore their table). Thus, now the user knows at least what regex can do, and they will read further if they wish to use the tool.   To add on to the introduction, I believe most people just don't know *what* regex is capable of. And again since your book is formatted similar to a doc, I still wouldn't get to know *what* regex can do, without reading at least 20+ pages. I think it'd be nice to have a section (could be the intro) that actually goes through 1 simple example that summerizes the idea of each section in your book (again like the above link, search, find, split, etc.), and maybe a hyperlink that jumps to that section. But this is just a personal preference, I'd like to see what the book can offer right off the bat, otherwise I probably won't go too into it. And, it'll be easy for me to look back if I ever forget (I forgot what re.search does, right in the intro there is a hyperlink I can click to jump to it0.   Regardless, I think it's great, and I've personally bookmarked it. Thank you!"

Looking forward to saving some time, at the very least having a quick resource to go to instead of sifting through questions on stack overflow. Seems like its quite well written, though as another person mentioned probably more geared toward the intermediate to advanced user. Do a dumbed down \"intro to RegEx\" with examples pointing to your website. I highly doubt majority of intermediate to advanced users are going to navigate to your site to try examples anyhow. Most would likely see an application from the get go."

I haven't started it at all. Video course, again not started yet. I recently came across sites that can help with creating text-based interactive course with development enviroment baked in the website itself. I'm currently leaning towards this because they also would do the marketing stuff and provide initial review before publishing.>Also, github is sort of a place for people who already know some of this stuff, I skimmed the first few pages of text and it seems you are writing towards a more advanced user. If that is your intent then that is great.I'm using GitHub to provide the markdown source of the book and an easy access to code snippets, exercises, etc. My intention is to cater to primarily beginners to regex, provided they are already familiar with Python syntax and programming basics. Another comment suggested that I improve the introduction chapter to show *what* regex can do and summarize the book. Hopefully, that'll make it more accessible to beginners.Thanks a lot for the feedback and ideas. I'll take some time to reflect and make changes accordingly."

                "comment": "> However, there isn't quite an introduction. The book is partitioned less like a book, and more like documentation (i.e. here is first regex function, lets break down this function, then next function, etc.). If people are looking at this with no knowledge of regex, they are immediately thrown into a rabbit hole of different uses of regex, without understanding why they'd need it in the first place or what it can do.This has given me a lot of thinking to do. Thanks a lot for taking the time to go through the book and the detailed feedback. I'll go through the w3schools link as well as try to gather some more information about how to introduce *what* regex is capable of.>I think it'd be nice to have a section (could be the intro) that actually goes through 1 simple example that summerizes the idea of each section in your bookThis is another good idea and easy enough to do. Thanks again."

Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.`re` and `regex` are modules that help you with a wide variety of text processing needs. Here's some examples:    # split based on one or more digit characters    >>> re.split(r'\\d+', 'Sample123string42with777numbers')    ['Sample', 'string', 'with', 'numbers']    # swap words that are separated by a comma    >>> re.sub(r'(\\w+),(\\w+)', r'\\2,\\1', 'good,bad 42,24')    'bad,good 24,42'    # match if 'go' is not there between 'at' and 'par'    >>> bool(re.search(r'at((?!go).)*par', 'fox,cat,dog,parrot'))    True"

So, I started learning on and off about 4 years ago but never really stuck with it for longer than a few weeks. It wasn't until my 3rd or 4th attempt to start learning that I finally finished Automate the boring stuff and went onto the rest outlined in my post.I've been coding, or reading about coding for about 1-4 hours per day (4-6 days per week) over the last 18 months or so. It varies day by day but I at least try to get an hour or two in.As for time spent on this project, you can see from the [commit log](https://github.com/sam0jones0/amazon_wishlist_pricewatch/commits/master) that it was about one month. But the vast majority of that was spent reading about how to document, type check and test code properly. Most of the functionality was added in the first commit, the rest was learning.Doing 5 min of code per day is an absolute win and don't let yourself think otherwise.

I think I wanted to try and do it the \"one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it \" that would work on the most peoples configurations, but never really felt I found that \"one way\".I will defintely look into Poetry for my next project, it can simplify packaging then I'm all over it. Do you happen to know if a project configured with Poetry requires the end-user to also be using Poetry or does it integrate well with the setuptools/pip environment?"

If I could only take one thing from that book it would be the [chapter on algorithm analysis and Big-O notation](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds3/AlgorithmAnalysis/toctree.html).For me, Crash Course was absolutely helpful, I went over the first half much quicker as it does go over the basics again. As great as ATBS is, it doesn't contain much beyond single-file scripts, while very useful I felt lost regarding multi-file programs/projects. The second half of Crash Course is perfect for this, goes into enough detail without forgetting it's still a beginners book.Check out the chapters under \"Part 2\" of [this table of contents](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e)."

To me, Automate served as a gentler entry point and quicker access to actionable/useful things.So yeah I'd move on to that data structures book, codewars, small project or any other \"next-step\" in line with your interests."

Get lost in those rabbit holes pertaining to one particular aspect of a problem. There is a lot of banging your head against the wall and feeling hopelessly stuck when learning to code (at least there was for me, pretty sure this goes for everyone), totally normal. Sometimes it's a temporary gap in knowledge, or sometimes its a misplaced colon. Each time I got stuck in one of these moments, I'd remember how many times I've been in this position before, and that I eventually always found a way out. Remembering that each time worked a slight sense of comfort into the extreme discomfort of feeling that stuck.If you feel stuck I would suggest continuing with a mix of guided learning (books/tutorials) while ([as another commenter pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/n6yd44/finally_feel_ive_graduated_from_complete_beginner/gxayrwr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) extending the code taught to you in the tutorial as much as you can before moving onto the next section. I spent months reading through books/tutorials while eeking my way into codewars.Beyond that, remember to reach out and ask for help here or otherwise.

                "comment": "Hey! You don't *need* github in the early stages of your learning, I didn't start using it until I was comfortable with the basics/core concepts. That said, consider it like an \"oober-powerful-quicksave\". It lets you save the exact state of a project at a point in time.So lets say you \"commit\" (save #1) your work so far and then continue working for a few weeks on some new features. You realise that your new features completly break the whole project, uh oh. Thankfully, you can easily roll back your project to the exact state it was in when you made that first commit (save #1) a few weeks earlier.Lets say that you want to keep those new features you made in case they come in useful later. But you still want to roll the project back to that first state (save #1). Well, you could make a new \"branch\" and save/commit the broken codebase (with the new features) there. You then continue working on save #1 and are free to revisit those new features at a later date, perhaps even \"merge\" the two branches together at some point.There are many more advanced features to git (github is a git \"repository\" hosting service) which I'm not even close to understanding. All you really need when getting started is to get into the habit of comitting your changes on a regular basis so you can always roll back when needed. Plus, \"pushing\" your commits to somewhere like github gives you an off-site back-up to protect against hard-drive failure etc.I'm sure there are cleaner explanations of git and github out there, and you should have a google when you feel you've got the core python concepts down.Best of luck!

I spent so long looking at those \"10 projects every beginner dev needs to do\" lists you'll find online, but couldn't bring myself to make another calculator or to-do list, as benefical as I'm sure writing them would be.I wanted something with an actual use case, even just for one person. What helped me was asking friends if ... In fact I'll just copy-paste the message I sent them in a whatsapp group chat:&#x200B;>Sup everyone, I'm having somewhat of a coders block. Want to code something to beef up my portfolio but haven't trouble thinking of any actually useful projects. Rather than just make another calculator app or something.  >  >If anyone has any ideas (no matter how domain-knowledge specific e.g. music, journalism, gaming whatever) let me know please!  >  >Think in the domain of \"is there some thing I do which I wish was automated\". It can be something that works on files, spreadsheets, databases, websites, runs in the background or needs a GUI... whatever!&#x200B;That got quite a few responses thankfully. If you don't have many friends or don't want to ask them perhaps ask something similar in a subreddit of a niche interest of yours?One friend needed help working with excel sheets for his job, another suggested the amazon wishlist project I ended up going with. Another idea suggested I was thinking about, but haven't worked on yet was: \"I've always wished there were an app that could tell you when it's ok to go pee in the cinema without missing anything important\". Your welcome to that if you want :PBest of luck whatever you decide to do! And of course you're always welcome to contribute to my amazon wishlist project"

It gets the cogs turning in the subconscious/background and keeps it fresh. Also, if you convince yourself you're only gonna do 5 minutes you can often trick yourself into working for longer -- \"now I've started it's not so bad\". And codewars is great for this, you can drop in, read the problem and think \"hell naw\"... then lo and behold you'll be on the toilet a few hours later and a spark of inspiration will come and off you run to the computer (trousers round your ankles no doubt) to have another go at the problem.Regarding the questions:&#x200B;1. &#x200B;The 3rd book doesn't contain much you'd actually be writing in a standard programming role, but it introduces concepts that *will* make you a better programmer overall. So I would say yes, it is worth working through... But don't get too hung up trying to remember how to write all those algorithms, rather the concepts the author is trying to get across on good program design. I mentioned in another comment recently that if I had to pick just one chapter from that book it would be the one on [computional complexity / Big-O Notation / algortihm analysis](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds3/AlgorithmAnalysis/toctree.html).If you're still unsure how about reading these two (short) chapters first: 1) [Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types?](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds3/Introduction/WhyStudyDataStructuresandAbstractDataTypes.html) and 2) [Why Study Algorithms?](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds3/Introduction/WhyStudyAlgorithms.html).Learning about data types really helped me think about how to best organise data I'm working with and the algorithms are just darn cool if you ask me.&#x200B;2.**Packaging**Packaging is a bit of a mind-bender to get your head around as there are so many competing standards. But you'll only need to learn it once and it will seem simple enough after that. Have a read through another answer on this thread [I wrote on packaging](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/n6yd44/finally_feel_ive_graduated_from_complete_beginner/gxedi3z?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Beyond that I would refer to [this awesome packaging guide](https://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the official(?) [python packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/).&#x200B;**Testing**I decided on PyTest after googling around and reading other peoples opinions on this very here sub. To actually learn how to do it I found the book [Python Testing with Pytest: Simple, Rapid, Effective, and Scalable by Brian Okken](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34695799-python-testing-with-pytest) very helpful. Also:\\- [This site](https://pythontesting.net/start-here/) is an excellent all around testing resource\\- And a shorter rundown of [pytest here](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)&#x200B;**Documentation**There are a few different standards of docstrings, I ended up going with Google's style as it looked the cleanest to me. To get a good overview of documenting code and the various styles people use, I recommend giving [this page](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) a good read.If you decide to go with Google style docstrings, they are explained in [Google's python style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#doc-function-args) quite well. And check out [this page](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html#example-google) for some more examples.[One last link](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing_docstring.html) for you that provides many more examples and guidance on \"best practices\" etc.&#x200B;**Git / Github**Have a read of [this page](https://realpython.com/python-git-github-intro/) for a good overview of git. I also wrote [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/n6yd44/finally_feel_ive_graduated_from_complete_beginner/gxdfw8d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this thread going over the general use-case for git for a beginner to Python. It may look like you need to learn a whole set of command-line commands to use git/github, but in all honesty I do 99% of my interaction with github through GUI buttons baked into my code editor (I use PyCharm, but most of them integrate well with git).&#x200B;Phew, I think that covers it!

I wouldn't worry about projects initially and just get really comfortable with the basics. A project doesn't have to be big, it can be a ten line script you wrote to automate something random that came to mind, thats a win.Keep a folder of all the things you make over time and soon enough you'll have a repo of snippets and useful tools that could coalesce into something bigger.Once you've finished with Automate the boring stuff I really recommend [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) as it does go into project-orientated territory. It goes over the core concepts in the first half so if you're not feeling Automate the boring stuff for whatever reason feel free to move right on Crash Course.Reach out in a pm here or on github if you ever need any help!"

The trickiest thing I've seen so far is the defining of a command line program (where you're not just building a library, but a program people can call on the CLI). There's an example of this in my referenced project though if you're going down that road."

I also read through [this](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) Real Python page.It certainly is confusing when starting out, but I promise it does clarify in time. Make sure you're not *only* learning from videos, they are helpful but I think there is a real benefit in reading through a book/tutorial's trail of thought at your own pace, and then writing it up into your own code editor.I can't recommend Python Crash Course (linked above) enough, it goes over the core concepts really well in the first half. But it's not until part 2 (the projects) where I really solidified my understanding of OOP as it's used extensively in each one of the projects.Understanding won't come all at once, just keep working through and come back to sections you didn't quite grasp the first time round.Let me know how you get on!"

I must have spent the best part of a week reading about packaging for this project.All the following assumes you don't just go with Poetry. The key takeaways from my research were:I found [this thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/where-to-get-started-with-pyproject-toml/4906/6) helpful explaining the differences and use cases between these 3 files. There are 3 main files used in packaging/building. setup.py, setup.cfg and pyproject.toml. People are moving away from setup.py, although there are still reasons to keep it around but usually it's pretty empty, only containing one or two snippets if anything at all. It seems the main reason setup.py is kept around is to retain the ability to do editable installs (pip install -e .).If you're not interested in editable installs then you can do away with setup.py entirely (unless some other part of your build explicitly requires it for whatever reason). [This article](https://snarky.ca/what-the-heck-is-pyproject-toml/) clearly lays out out the case for a pyproject.toml / setup.cfg project.&#x200B;As per [this link](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2021-transition-to-pyproject.toml-example.html):> The future of Python packaging is pyproject.toml, and (for now) setup.cfg, based on [PEP 518](https://snarky.ca/clarifying-pep-518/) and (soon) [PEP 621](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/). &#x200B;So, with a mostly empty setup.py. You can put the majority of your configuration in setup.cfg and/or pyproject.toml. They accomplish similar things, but depending on your setup (which tools / packages you're using) you may have a need for both. Here's a couple more links I found helpful:\\- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64150719/how-to-write-a-minimally-working-pyproject-toml-file-that-can-install-packages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64150719/how-to-write-a-minimally-working-pyproject-toml-file-that-can-install-packages)\\- [https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)&#x200B;Hope this helps rather than complicates your train of thought. I'm defintely looking into Poetry for my next project."

My only exposure to it at the moment is using [bootstrap.js](https://getbootstrap.com/) as part of a \"Python Crash Course\" book project. As you may know, javascript is heavily focused (but not exclusively) on the web browser.If I do move on to another programming language (which I almost certainly will once I'm really **really** comfortable with Python) it will probably be a more powerful and statically / strongly typed language such as C++ or Rust."

Apart from that just working on side projects and studying the algorithms/leetcode for job interviews etc :)That's great to about how focused you are keeping yourself, it can be tough sometimes but it sounds like you've got a handle on distractions. No zero days really helped me as well, do something productive every day.As for games, I like to play them as well but generally stay away from any online games, as I find they hack your brain into obsessiveness more easily than offline games. I've been enjoying FTL (Faster than light) and Highfleet recently. Both are great strategy games.On the priority of programming, I'd say for me it comes pretty high but that's primarily because I enjoy it so much! Not to say there aren't days when its hard to keep motivated, but I think that's the case with everything. Lots of people recommend finding other people who share your passion and chat with them to keep your perspective and motivation fresh. Maybe see if there are any local Javascript meet-ups in your area? I am looking for some friendly-looking Python meet-ups around me.Look forward to hearing how you've been getting on!"

About 5 years ago I made a hard shift into automation and development. As I grew in my networking career I became stronger and stronger at problem solving and figured it would carry over to other areas of IT. Not so much...We forget the struggles of the entry level engineer in our field pretty quickly. It wasn't until I went through it again that I realized how hard it is. Very humbling.Documentation and googling/research is 10x harder for entry level as they have no idea what they are looking for and what the correct terms to use in their search. I can craft a detailed search for complex routing topics and almost always have an answer in two clicks. For pytest I can search for hours on how to use a basic feature without any progress. Technical documentation has an assumed level of knowledge and few are good at catering to entry level.With all that said, there is a balance you need to help your teammates with. Yes it's valuable for them to learn how to figure out a problem on their own, but you also need to mentor and help just as much. This is what we expect from leaders and our peers for our own growth. Learn to recognize when they are over their head and making no progress. Learn to recognize when they are defeated and lost. They might not know they are (they are learning this too) but this is when you step in. Teaching and mentoring does not have to come from Sr level roles. 9 times out of 10 someone is more receptive to someone right above their skill level than a highly skilled Sr engineer. That is because they relate more to you then them."

How can I \"google the problem\" if I don't know exactly what the problem is? Sometimes there are obvious cases where i.e. I receive an error message and can google that, but other times I might be having problems with control flow/logic and it isn't immediately obvious what the solution is. I spent half a day last week trying to figure out why I couldn't get some code to count instances of a word in a list of strings. I thought I'd tried everything, I'd used the count function and failed to get it working with the way I'd structured my code, I thought my problem was due to control flow in my loops, I just wasn't able to get the output I wanted. When I searched online for answers, the results directed me to Regex and importing modules from libraries.I asked a question here and it turned out to be a simple error with an implementation of my \"occurrence counter\" combined with a flawed understanding of membership operators. About two minutes after posting a question, a nice person replied saying (x won't work, it does y. Count() will work if you use z). With that insight, I corrected my approach in about 30 seconds and the code worked the first time I ran it.Eight hours of head-banging frustration. Obviously the onus is on me to try and ensure I understand what the hell I'm studying, but the end result is I spent many hours searching for a solution to a misidentified problem."

In some cases I just literally pasted the question and added \"python\" at the end... no need for fancy knowledge on how google finds stuff.Same with many of my own issues. I remember one of my first \"big\" issues was that I needed to minimize a function with respect to multiple dimensions. Just googling \"two dimension minimization python\" and browsing through the results gave me the answer. Back then it took me some time to recognize the most adequate solution, but that time isn't wasted if in the end you lear something.Also by doing it on your own you learn how to quickly discard solutions that don't fit your problem, which is a very important hability on the long term."

However, I would make the claim that it often pales in comparison to getting direct help from those experienced with the program. This, in my opinion, is because the Internet answers often give only a very narrow \"slice of the pie\" - - with the focus most often being on providing the solution rather than teaching the use of a tool.From personal experiences, I've been self-taught in the majority of my sysadmin and developer work, with university only really giving the foundation needed. It wasn't until I joined a workplace that I realized how my knowledge was full of gaps... Because I would usually get solutions from the Internet or trial-and-error. The experienced members on my team helped fill in those gaps with better methods of doing the same thing, how to stay aware of security and performance, tools and resources I had never heard of before, and general best practices.It's why I always applaud the wonderful Internet folk that go above and beyond in their answers, explaining not just the how... But the why, when, and where as well. Searching for answers is a wonderful quick fix, especially if you come across good posts like that, but nothing quite compares to knowledge passed down by a mentor."

My question is regarding the implementation of the graph adjacency list using linked lists in python! Basically, I was working on the code from geeks for geeks on adjacency lists:\"\"\" A Python program to demonstrate the adjacency list representation of the graph \"\"\"    # A class to represent the adjacency list of the node`class AdjNode:`  `def init(self, data):``self.vertex = data``self.next = None`    # A class to represent a graph. A graph is the list of the adjacency lists. Size of the array will be the no. of the vertices \"V\"`class Graph:`  `def init(self, vertices):``self.V = vertices``self.graph = [None] * self.V`    # Function to add an edge in an undirected graph `def add_edge(self, src, dest): # Adding the node to the source node`  `node = AdjNode(dest)`  `node.next = self.graph[src] #Please explain`  `self.graph[src] = node #Please explain`\\# Adding the source node to the destination as it is the undirected graph  `node = AdjNode(src)`  `node.next = self.graph[dest]`  `self.graph[dest] = node`In this code, I'm not able to wrap my head around the add\\_edge method. I don't understand the lines that I've commented with \"Please Explain\". I know the comments in the code itself should suffice to understand the code but I'm sorry I couldn't understand. I researched on stack overflow, google, etc. There were answers available, but all were either too generic or not at all easy to understand. Experts, can you please help me understand what are those two lines of code doing? P.S - Sorry about the formatting and grammar.

Second, it will force me to fix my current questions to get unbanned which means I will need to put a lot of work into thinking hard about expanding the value of my questions for others and this will necessitate thinking hard about coding problems. A great learning opportunity.Third, it has made me search for other ways to solve problems through breaking down code, reading up, slowly rebuilding and testing and reading more. I may spend a week stuck on one problem but that’s actually not bad, it’s progress. It may just be a week of reading and watching but it is contextualised and relevant and that is where powerful learning happens.Ironically, getting banned from stack exchange has taught me more than having access every did. So thank you Stack Exchange for teaching me to code."

Imagine the learning curve, when you don't have experience in troubleshooting from a day job, and then you attempt to learn google and programming. People who come from a technical background start further along this path than those that don't. Those without an IT background are also more easily susceptible to just buying a course and being stuck in tutorial hell."

The memes about googling all the time are true, but as others have said, it is something that takes practice. The more often you google and check documentation, the better you get at solving unexpected snags and errors from a library, and you develop an intuition about whether an error message going to be solved by google or if it's not the right kind of error and you have to read documentation and retrace your code, etc. There's no real rules here that'll guarantee anything; it's something you just have to get a feel for by experience.Pro-tip: Use Google and stay logged in. Privacy and stuff aside, when their algorithms learn you are looking for programming questions they will give you better results. This is especially stark for the Rust language, for example, which is also the name of a video game. It is nice how Google search learns to filter the game from your searches (or at least, they are further down the results). \"Rust raid array join docs\" means the programming language, not \"how to join a raid in the Rust video game\". Other pro-tip: Medium articles are often by people who are copying existing tutorials, to pump out content and make a 'portfolio' or online presence. There are alternative ways to search for example code, like github gists and existing projects that use (and sample projects from) the same libraries. They are much better quality. Though they might seem at first to be less approachable, they are really great once you get a feel for navigating and using them."

I feel the bigger problem is with a proper learning/coding habit, and not because someone doesn't know the syntax. Coding is solving problems, syntax is secondary. This just translates into not properly trying to formulate the problem because you aren't breaking it down and you are doing too much at once.A lot of people strive to find a solution but not understanding the problem. And the fact is, if you don't understand the problem you can't find a solution.Personally, I find when I create a post when I'm stuck, a lot of times I find the solution myself fairly fast afterwards because creating a post pushes me to break down the problem better."

I learn better if i see a few ways to implement the specific method/feature.This is me. Learning python to try to develop a display/interface for my custom ebike motor controller.All the elements i need are working, but they're all rather procedural, and now I have hundreds of lines of code that can do either A, or B, or C, but not simultaneously. After a few ***days*** of hair pulling, a one-liner from this subreddit led me to realize I need asyncio and probably threading to do what I want. But finding relevant examples has been really hard! There's a lot to consider and the advanced topics like asyncio and threading are not described with beginners like me in mind."

                "comment": ">  I learn better if i Let me go ahead and stop you there. What you say may be true, but it's not strictly relevant. Documentation is not intended to be a tutorial. Writing documentation is a pain in the ass as it is, and too few developers write decent documentation at all. You cannot expect developers to include examples of every corner case because that's how you prefer to ingest the information. You would *actually* learn better if the documentation told you how the code is implemented and then you experimented with it until you figured out how it works for your problem. There are many valid points of discussion in this thread. But too often, these conversations do not emphasize the necessity for beginner and intermediate developers to learn to synthesize information. Examples are always good. More is always better. But you don't often get more. Which means you have to read the documentation that's provided and make sure you understand how the example is using the code and how you have to change it to match your use case. So, yes, I agree that the biggest problem is being able to correctly search for the information you want. But a very close second is the problem of reading multiple sources, including official documentation if it exists, and permuting that until you get your problem sorted out. There are so many examples of so many things out there, that beginners become irrationally annoyed when someone hasn't already solved their specific problem for them. This isn't learning."

I.e. loops, counters, implementations of functions and so forth. StackExchange is nice, but usually the top results are \"high-level\" explanations for why things work or won't work, but that explanation doesn't always seem immediately useful to a beginner (who lack the ability to translate their code based upon holistic explanations). Part of learning sometimes involves \"using it before you understand it\". Someone else mentioned it in this thread, but there really aren't enough examples of code out there to refer to. I would enjoy being able to look through (for example) *hundreds* of varied implementations of loops for different data structures, data types, and i.e. type conversion within the loops.

Just understanding the problem is the important part and doesn't necessarily imply you know how to solve it if you understand the problem. The comment I replied to mainly linked not being able to ask the right questions was because someone doesn't know the proper syntax, which isn't the case from my experience.   > That's not really a fact, just recently I needed to copy a file to the Java folder of code for Spark to authentication to work.

Anything you can accomplish with classes can be accomplished without them as well, but sometimes it's neater to use classes to solve a problem.The issue with how classes are taught is that they focus on real world objects rather than computer concepts. As an example of something that functions well as a class is a representation of a connection with something. An instance of the object is a connection to a discrete endpoint of some sort, and it's methods send(), receive(), close(), and status() are ways to get information too and from that endpoint as well as managing the state. Accomplishing this without a class is completely possible, but that means you have to maintain all the information about the state in the namespace of the program while using a class will keep that information internally in the object. In addition, having more than one connection means having to duplicate the state management over more variables, while with a class you just instantiate another object.Classes have their place and they simplify a lot of things for you by abstracting things away, but they can also be very messy if you apply them to the wrong problem."

Way better! But now it's looking like a product, may as well put it up on the company's AWS account. So you start up an EC2 server behind a load balancer that is deployed all by hand. OMG that's such a pain, though, so you decide to learn Jenkins and github actions. Now people are seeing the web app and they want more features ... right now! So your company sends you to an AWS developers class and/or an AWS architects class and you learn about api gateway, lambda, fargate, eks, etc. You decide to use the CDK to develop a serverless application using Lambda because it'll be so cheap. But while you're researching that you found AWS Amplify and AWS Appsync and you decide to go for it. You set up a basic React single page app with Cognito authentication and AppSync GraphQL backend in 10 minutes. This is all supported by dynamodb. It's not the cheapest option, but it's still basically free given your limited number of users. Now you are in the position of being able to write schema and have AppSync automatically create the resolvers.Congrats, you're a full stack developer. Don't forget the tests!"

Yesterday I picked up and washed a few almost glass clear gypsum crystals from a sample we received from. Customer. It's a pretty great job if you can live without the field trips. My work is probably more chemical engineer than geologist these days though. I still have the geology part activated whenever we get unmarked samples though.I hope to use it to automate phase recognition and quantification and in time maybe also have it determine various internal features. The minerals we look for are stained with an etching and it is often uneven in the coloration it gives which is a good example of a problem where human experience makes identification trivial, but it is hard to make a simple algorithm to deal with it. Eventually I may have to apply deep learning to the problem. So that is slowly what I am working towards with my studies."

You \"generate\" random data (for distribution purposes likely), but you wrote it in by hand. See if you can create a handy little function for duplicating all those lists.The benefit to you is really for testing. It'd let you try out your code and changes in a faster and repeatable manner.

My previous job was the first where I got to use any programming ability. I wasn't asked to do it or hired to do it, but when you save a company thousands of staff hours it makes quite the impact! It's often surprising that even in tech companies, there's an awful lot that could be automated but it's just never occurred to anyone. Keep it up."

I finally did the followup MIT course in nov-dec 2019 and then it somehow clicked and felt more natural. Still have a ton to learn obviously though, but what really makes me happy is that I knew exactly where to go for examples of parts of my program so I could quickly whip this up.Regarding the random data I actually made it with a quick for loop and the random module in my IPython console in Spyder. I just didn't think to put it in here. But your point is valid in general and I will remember it.I have recently started using Jupiter notebooks for testing and it works fabulously, but I'll admit I didn't for this script.Thanks for the kind words in general. Feels good to know I am getting somewhere 😊"

                "comment": "It is actually not that far from what we have with excel now. A test is initiated in the 3rd party software. The lab technician activate the test and it generates an excel-based worksheet which they then fill out (often printed so they can bring it along, then entering in the notes later in the digital copy). When that is done they will export the file or notify the engineer responsible for that test to review it. In the latter case the engineer then exports it. The export is a simple file (though I don't think it is a CSV - I have to check) and then that is processed by \"The Importer\" which is basically a computer running a small script (VBS I believe) that will scan a specific import folder for new files, then read them, import them correctly into our db and then delete the file and go back to waiting for a new file to show up. This is great for all our new data, and I doubt we can live without excel for this workflow (: There has been talks about building a whole system in Excel only and ditch the license-heavy 3rd party package). What would be natural in that situation is to let Python do some of the heavy lifting and putting much more of our data into the db rather than store it in the worksheets. The good thing about Excel is it is easy for most of our employees to handle, some of them comes from backgrounds as a mechanic, blacksmith etc. They are not necessarily that comfortable with computers in general, but the excel thing works for them."

We are also overwhelmingly an internal lab servicing other departments in the company, so we don't really have competition, because top level management dictates other departments have to use us, and consequently we don't have time for many external customers :)We have actually discussed this. The suggestion has so far been to build even more in Excel and then dump the 3rd party Lab management system. That could *maybe* be feasible with some faster behind the scenes python to support it. Otherwise it would probably be very slow and clunky."

It sounds like that excel-based worksheet is a good candidate for a web-based form that could (and probably should) render \"The Importer\" obsolete. \"The Importer\" is probably complicated, hard to update, hard to maintain, and just generally fragile, I'm guessing. A web service back end could directly handle the insertion into a database and would give a ton of other advantages like logging and easy maintenance and upgrades.But like I said, whether the investment this effort requires is worth it is up to your company. Maybe check with IT to see if there is a team that can help facilitate this. It could be that if you know the \"right\" direction, you might be able to get someone to implement it for you."

The pattern to inspect your local variables is:* import pdb; pdb.set_trace()this opens a debugging prompt and you use:* q - quit;* n - next;* s - step (jumps into a function call instead of just evaluating under the hood);* w - where (where in the script are you);* l - list (print the lines before and after current line);and in conjunction with *dir()*, a built-in function that allows you to inspect all the names in the current scope, you can learn everything about how your program runs."

Perhaps think about how the data can be grabbed from the the instrument, parsed, automatic basic qc checks applied, imported to a database and then pushed to a data approver (a person). It should be displayed in a format where they can assess the quality of the data,likely a browser. They then assess for passing CRM, blanks, duplicates etc. Adjustments can then be made to the data if so needed. Everything is audit trailed for transparency and accountability."

It was simple, read the log file, catch a phrase, do something. Data was all csv.So I started modifying it to add things, and breaking it. I spent more time coding the bot than playing the game. I gave away server time for groups so I could mine data (I still feel dirty). I started with basic knowledge and now have a *decently* working full fledged tracker that -* records log on/log off time* tracks steamid, viking, connected status, how long they've played* death tracker* help page for the bot commands* bot commands for last online, players connected, time played, deaths, 12/24/weekly player count graph* an eviction checker for players not online for 5 days* restart server, update server bot commands* various bot commands to modify back end db* magic 8 ball, yes/no, and coin flip bot commands just becauseI started with migrating the csv to MySQL using pandas to read and mysql for writes. It sort of worked but I was chasing crazy bugs because I had no idea what I was doing. Spent a lot of time getting help in the Python discord channel, having discussions, lurking, and figuring out what I needed to learn next. Pandas basics - check. After a lot of hardship, I found the random bug problem. The main loop was an async function and all my functions were sync. WTF is async? So I learn about async functions and loops. Converted sync functions to async and it worked better, but MySQL doesn't support async. *await* Find a sqlite library that supports async. *await* Convert MySQL queries to sqlite. I learn db basics during all this.I'm still learning. I'm still chasing bugs and random errors. I'm working on a log emulator with a graphical interface so I can trigger specific messages for testing. Now I'm learning django so I can build a web app to do this. I got the debugger set up to actually step through code and change variables, and I have a good reason to do it besides following another tutorial.The more I learn, the more I connect the dots, and the light bulbs come on like a Griswald Christmas movie.Find a project that inspires you, poke around on git, brain storm, fork someones idea because you can make it better, solve a problem that doesn't need to be solved.I wrote all this simply because no one in my life can grasp the feeling of accomplishment it is to have a working program that is actually useful in some way. r/learnpython is a constant inspiration and will teach you the basic from just lurking, and I can't thank the folks on the python discord enough. Any tough problem I had, someone was willing to help correct code or give advice on the spot. It's a great place to ask questions or get leads on things you might not know yet. So OP is correct, get to coding to solve a problem. Now I'm integrating programming into my professional life slowly, just simple data analysis for now (thanks pandas), but it's like being the excel wiz in the office only better."

Think of it as picking up cooking as a hobby; At first you have to get the recipes, get the utensils, get your kitchen ready... But unless you start actually cooking stuff, all that you'll achieve is that your kitchen is getting full of increasingly specialized utensils, that your bookshelves overflow with cookbooks, and that you're still not able to make much more than an omelet unless you take one of those recipes and actually try making it."

You have to write *a lot* of code over a long period of time to become a good programmer."

Than figure out the rest by getting my hands dirty at all times. I learn much faster this way than some silly course I have to pay for. I grab a few books, mostly for references and continue learning this way. This method never fail me of learning of things I like to learn. Than I can continue to create my own stuff. It's the willing and full effort to learn. This is how I learn to code."

In the internet there's everything you need to know.3. ***Refactor the solution until I feel there's nothing more I can optimize***. This is the part where I REALLY improve as a programmer.4. BONUS: Look at challenges in codewars, etc. Look how other people solve the same problems and, if you find a better way. Add it to point 3.5. BONUS2: ***NEVER*** copypaste code. If you need some exact code snippet then you should write it char by char. Hand memory is real in this case."

Most of the courses are pretty bad in terms of teaching the language interestingly, but there are pretty good courses too! If you just write code without learning the basics, you won't be a programmer. You will be a script kiddie. I do believe the big difference between a programmer and script kiddie is the level of knowledge of the basics. If you don't know what a variable is, you are a script kiddie. Nowadays, languages like JS or Python provide you a high enough syntax to just write code without thinking about the type of the variable. Of course, this comes with a price: Performance. And if you are programming with Python or high-level languages, it won't really matter if you understand how variables work, as the language takes care of that. But it is good to know what OOP actually is under the hood, how the language creates variables, etc. Scripting straight away will give you a lot of experience in debugging, but others, who took the time to read the specs and docs for the language, will be better in long term."

If you're bored and breezing through it, you can probably just skip and start a project.This is just my opinion but I find a lot of ppl especially on this sub are so focused on picking the right course when it doesn't matter that much, I think (not rlly for python but coding in general) it's much more useful to learn technologies/frameworks, especially if you're learning with the intention of getting a job/add to your resume.Like for a lot of more advanced things in python, yea, they're cool, but you can accomplish the same thing just by using the basics. Also even if you are insanely skilled at using python, you can't have two lines on your resume saying, you're good at python and you're rlly good at python. Usually jobs are looking for what technologies you've used.Even if you're just doing it for fun, I think it's better to learn new technologies/frameworks to open up many more possibilities for what you can do"

Other comments, and my reading of it, is more along the lines of sketch your program before writing it. Draw up a project plan and flow chart so that you go in to write the code only having to think 'how do I write the syntax for the McGuffin' rather than sitting down to code and thinking both 'what am I doing here and how do I write the McGuffin once I know what it is supposed to do'."

Once you have been doing it for a while, or are just familiar with logic, it is probably better for you to actually type as you go. But since I am currently learning, sometimes it is hard to break down what I want to do properly in the way the language wants. So writing it out kinda helps me breakdown what I want more efficiently if that makes sense.Edit. It's easier for me to focus on syntax and methods when I have the plan sketched out even in an abstract workflow, rather than worrying about both at the same time."

It's frustratingly difficult to adjust whether or not you put the parenthesis before or after the name when you're on autopilot.My point was though that once you know the language, those aren't usually mistakes you need to look up (or at least I haven't found them to be). I make the mistake during the transition, but readily know the problem as soon as I get the syntax error. Remembering the exact order of arguments in every function in all the languages I know though? Ppsh. I'll forget a function's argument order minutes after reading the documentation if it's not a function I use often."

So I decided to try projects. I don't know what's wrong with me, I cannot do any of them. I can do basic number generators and calculators but anything above that is just impossible. Right now I tried tic tac toe and I was so flabbergasted because HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO EVEN KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE BOARD?  I searched up a tutorial, only watched the first couple of seconds to get a small start and just continue off of there based on ideas.  But no, I cant, I'm stuck.  I try breaking down the problem it does not work, I've tried everything.  \"Ok, I first need to draw the board. oh I ALREADY FAILED,\"  \"Ok what about user input\" and then I get the user input and I am just clueless.  Watching a tutorial does not help because I won't learn. Man how can I develop, please help me."

This is going to sound cliche but from your comment, it sounds like the main thing holding you back is your mentality that you can't, rather just thinking that you can't, just code what you can, figure out what specifically is blocking you, then ask about thatSo let's take tictactoe:- So you're stuck on the board, presumably how to show the board, you can go the easy route and make it all text based, so just print out the board after every turn, or you can have a fancier display (a GUI)- Now you don't know how to make a GUI, let's say you didn't even know the word GUI, you can search it up, something like \"how do to display my game python\" (always add what language you're writing in)- From there, you get a ton of pages talking about this library pygame, so you try mimicking what they're doing but it doesn't work, looks like you need more tailored help, so you can go on reddit and make a post. Something like \"this is what I'm trying to do, this is my code, what am I doing wrong\" there should be tons of ppl who can help you spot what's wrong with your code- From there, you'd have a working display but it's just showing an empty board, of course, we haven't coded any state or game logic (aka remembering which squares are marked and what to do on certain inputs like the first 3 in a row), so from there you start adding more code, when you get stuck search up your problem and if you can't find any solutions, make a post and ask about your specific problemI think those were all short logical steps that you could make. When you're doing a project, just think, what are you missing. For the things you're missing, what do you need to do before that. Do you know how to do it? If not, search it up. Like for tictactoe, I'd do the state and game logic first because for me, it's easier and I know how to do it whereas I'm not as familiar with pygame.So overall, do what you can, if you can't figure it out, search it up, and if that doesn't help, ask online, the internet is your friend. Most of the time spent coding will be debugging, not typing out code and searching things up is natural. I currently work a dev job and I do significantly more debugging and searching online than straight typing out code.You're not supposed to know how to do things from the start. There are constantly new technologies I have to use and obviously I'm not going to know how to do it. So usually I'll look at a tutorial first. Try to get gist for how things work. I like to play around with the code and adjust to really figure out what it does and how to manipulate it to do what I want. From there I try to adapt it to my needs. If there's something I don't know how to do, I search it up. For example \"how do I display a video in React\" (React is a technology for making websites) But without searching it up, there's no way I'd know how to do it."

The point is not that you will *complete the project* (spoilers: you won't) the point is that programming is the art of problem-solving, and you only learn how to do that by encountering problems. Trying to determine a project that is \"appropriate for your skill level\" - that is, that won't cause you any problems - works at cross purposes to that.What people make these posts to ask is basically \"what's the pathway where I don't encounter any difficult problems that would impede my progress\" and the correct answer is \"probably one where you're not very good at writing software by the end of it.\""

                "comment": "I'm about your age but have been programming my whole adult life. I can tell you for certain there is one thing that will help you get up to speed and be a productive programmer more than anything else. First a story.I am not a sports fan. I do not enjoy watching sports at all. I do not like to watch them on TV or in person. I have seen major local franchises win it all and it did not effect me in any way. I have tried to make myself care, I do not care. I can not care, it isn't in me. It would benefit me greatly if I liked sports. I could bond with other humans, maybe make some friends, certainly have things to talk to others about. \"Boy he really knows his sports\" is something nobody has ever said about me. I would LOVE to be a sports fan, it looks like a lot of fun. I had long since let that dream go when I heard a piece of advice from none other than Artie Lange.Artie said, and I'm paraphrasing here, something like this:\"Here is how you become interested in sports. Let's say you have $1,000 to your name. It's 100% of the money you have in the world. Now, go down to your local bookie and put $5,000 on the next game. You'll learn everything there is to know about that sport in one game and you won't miss a play.\"What he is saying is simple: to become interested in something you need to have incentive. That's how you get started, you have incentive. How you keep going is you get good at it. Why? Because we enjoy things we are good at. Who enjoys things they are not good at? Nobody. The problem is when you start something new, you are not good, so it is not fun, ergo: you need incentive.You want to be a Python programmer, but you do not know where to start? Eh, I don't buy that. Google \"I want to be a python programmer but I do not know where to start\" and you will find some place to start. That's not the problem. Your problem is twofold:1. You do not have incentive.2. You are not good at programming so it is not fun.You really can not do #2 without #1, so let's focus on #1. Incentive.This is going to be something you decide. Think about a simple (can't stress that enough) program that would make your life easier. Something you could run that would do some calculation or do some task that would be fun or useful to have. Don't worry about execution yet, just decide to write something that YOU need. You, personally. Now, open up a new word doc and write down, in plain english what that would be. Keep it simple. Do not add a ton of features right now, in fact, try to make it as simple as possible, but, something that is still useful. If you need to send yourself an email at 3pm every day that tells you the weather tomorrow, don't go adding in all kinds of colors and graphics in that email. That email should say:    Red Maxx tomorrow it is going to be cold and snowy with a high of 32 and a low of 20.No colors, no links, nothing fancy. It will do the one simple thing you wanted it to do.NOTE: If you are not excited by this piece of software you are planning to write, start over and pick something else.Now, you've picked the thing you want to write.You will be amazed at how fast obstacles fall away. You will surprise yourself with the sheer amount and type of code you write in a short time. When you look at your code from a month ago you will wonder how you were ever that dumb. This is the path to becoming a good programmer.Once you are a good programmer you will be having a lot of fun and the amount of personal excitement and interest you need will give way to something else: intellectual curiosity. You see, I tricked you a bit there. Not only were you getting good and having fun, you were also being exposed to new things in your language of choice (Python) and you will start to broaden your knowledge of what is POSSIBLE. That alone will keep you rolling on new, esoteric, interesting projects.Don't believe me?Buddy an entire ecosystem of code has been built this way, it's called 'open source software'. Do you think for a minute all those nerds writing all that code weren't learning and becoming interested? The servers that are running the website we are chatting right now were built because nerds were simply interested in IF they could do something.Believe me once you are rolling, you are going to wonder how you ever did anything else.The 3rd and final piece of advice I will give you is this: If you want to solidify your knowledge in your own mind and in a very formal way, teach Python to someone else. That will lock concepts into your brain in a way that nothing else will.Godspeed and good luck."

It’s also been limiting as far as career choices go.Ive realized that the projects I enjoy most are ones where I hack some code together, but I’m from from a legit software engineer. So I’ve been waking up at 5 most mornings and working my way through Udemy courses and some books I’ve bought. The biggest challenge I’ve found (other than time) is there is so much to learn to become competent, above and beyond just the languages themselves. For example, I was trying to work with a repo at work but had to install a Docker image for local dev. So I realized I need to add a Docker course to the list cause that was a foreign language. And then there’s Kubernetes. And Jenkins.  And the list goes onBut good luck on your journey and know that you aren’t alone!"

Four years ago a friend, who was at the time in his late forties, and I were listening to Jeff Buckley. My friend  told me he always regretted not learning the guitar. I said, \"Why not start now?\" and he mumbled some bullshit reply about that ship having sailed.I had never had an interest in learning an instrument but decided to learn that one guitar track to show him it's never too late. I haven't ever played that song to him but in the four years since there's probably been only twenty days when I haven't picked up a guitar and played. It's part of my life now and I absolutely LOVE it. I'll be pretty good in about five years, too.The point is, four years has gone by and my mate would probably still say he regrets not learning the guitar when he was younger.

I wouldn't have the job I have today without knowing Python.  There are just so many practical and real world applications for Python.  My wife and I homeschool our kids I am in the process of putting a \"summer school\" Python coding course together for my 12 year old.  I'm going to open it up to other families we know that homeschool as well.  Its a work in progress because there are basic code concepts and things like understanding binary and hexadecimal that we will have to cover first, before we even get started.  But kids are smart, I think they will pick it up quickly.  Its probably sad how giddy I am to teach the kids how to code."

Also, in good times management tends to expand, then in bad times these middle levels get streamlined.

Gotta know your data.Then once I got comfortable, I learn python to automate some task. Work there for about 2 years or so, then started to apply for developers jobs.I didn't get a job doing python, but it was c# that I needed to focus on. So it doesn't matter what programming language you learn, you will learn what your job is required. The basics of programming are very similar, with discipline you can learn your 2nd language within 2 months. The more languages you know the faster it is to pick up another.ALWAYS CONTINUE LEARNING.I am doing AWS Cloud engineer now.I started when I was 32."

It's largely application-based, since it's built around showing you how to automate this or that task. Think Python is also an excellent book and is more focused on teaching the nuts and bolts of the language. Not that Al's book doesn't also teach the fundamentals, but the books focus on different things. I think the two books go well together and aren't mutually exclusive."

Another person replied with exactly the same response with using Raspberry Pi and robotics.  I think its a fantastic idea and my kids love Minecraft too so Im going that route.edit1:  I forgot to share the link that was shared with me: [https://www.learnrobotics.org/blog/raspberry-pi-projects-kids/](https://www.learnrobotics.org/blog/raspberry-pi-projects-kids/)The more I look into this and asked my web/app stack developer coworkers... they recommended to:1. Scratch.   1. Teach Scratch first to learn the preliminary information and what it can do.  It will teach basic concepts.  It is really easy to learn since it is more visual based and have a lot of support on the iPad.2. Supplement with Lego Boost and/or Mindstorms.   1. I think Lego Boost is Scratch but maybe its Blockly.  I know that it can add a Scratch tool within the app so it supports Scratch in a kid friendly manner.3. Buy a Raspberry Pi kit.   1. What my coworker said is that her daughter picked it up faster because it was the next step to making it yourself.  She taught scratch, then showed them with legos and then said this is like advanced legos.4. Python.   1. The same coworker told me that while one kid is still making advances on the raspberry Pi... the older one wanted to do what mommy does and moved onto learning Python.  Her oldest wants to do more things in Minecraft but I think that minecraft is based upon Unity (C++?)While I think its the long way around to learning a single language... I believe my kids can learn how to apply coding to objects and teaches problem solving skills instead of teaching them how to be coders."

Each person could be responsible for a particular function which would lead to independent research. Then come back and share what was learned. This method requires previous knowledge or understanding on how to code.  With children, I believe, they need to go through the process from A to Z and grasp the understanding in their own way.  Unless Im missing something...For me, my son learns very different than my daughter.  My daughter requires a lot of repetition to understand something while my son requires understanding to perform a specific function.  It would suck because while I can teach myself through repetition and it will work for one kid... the understanding/comprehension would not be there for the other child because I dont understand the code myself.  Im \"forced\" to need to learn node.js and AS3 scripting for my work but to teach my children the way I understand something is not fair to them and becomes more of a chore.  But of course... that is this old mans opinion."

Took a college course and it got the ball rolling. From then on it was years of learning one little thing after another. Point being, you don't just do a course and now you're a developer.  It just doesn't work like that. It's a skill and like any skill it needs practice and time put in. Code combat has a free route. I'd start there. If they're interested and you can afford it, a tutor or a more advanced course might be a good next step. Tldr; time put in is honestly more important then specific content right now.

                "comment": "It really does depend on what you want to do, but I'll give you a list of some of my personal favorites as well as the ones that I use a lot. (Includes standard library modules and stuff from PyPI) - `os`/`shutil` - The `os` and `shutil` modules are both built in, and they are super useful. The `os` module basically provides a bunch of interfaces to your operating system; you can get the name, environment variables, work with paths, and do stuff with files and directories. The `shutil` module is a bit smaller, as it just contains a bunch of high-level file operations, like recursive copying/removing, an implementation of the Unix `which` command, and an implementation of `chown`. - `re` - I might be a little bit insane, but I really like regular expressions. The `re` module allows you to work with regular expressions, and it can be super powerful. Regular expressions can be super confusing, but like everything, you learn over time. Useful tip: you can comment regular expressions in Python, which is really nice. - `flask` - This is the first module from PyPI. Flask is a backend web framework written in Python. If you are good at Python and want to do backend, Flask is super powerful and really good for beginners. Another thing, if you're working with bigger projects with big databases, you could also look at `django`, just its really just preference. - `configparser` - Going back to stuff in the standard library, we have `configparser`. ConfigParser allows you to read/write to `.ini` files, allowing you to easily save user preferences for your program. It's super easy to use so I like it a lot. - `decimal` - This one can be super helpful. Have you ever tried to do math in Python and it is almost correct but slightly off, causing hours of debugging with no avail? That's because of something called \"Floating Point Precision Errors,\" and it's in most programming languages. Because of the way that computers add numbers with binary, when you do arithmetic on floats, things tend to break. For example, open up the Python interpreter and try running `1.1 * 3`. You should get something like `3.3000000000000003`. The `decimal` module can allow you to fix this. After importing `Decimal` from the `decimal` module, try running `Decimal(\"1.1\") * Decimal(\"3\")` and see what happens, it should be the correct answer now. -  `requests` - `requests` is a module from PyPI, and it is incredibly helpful. `requests` allows you to, well, send HTTP requests for one thing. You could do this with the builtin `urllib` module, but requests has more features and is so much easier to use.  - `argparse` - This one is built in, and it allows you to easily create command-line utilities. `argparse` will let you create different types of arguments, which can then be fed into your program to produce a result. - `PyQt5` - Interested in making GUIs but Tk isn't your favorite? Me too. I don't really create GUIs too often, but when I do, I like to use PyQt5. PyQt5 allows you to create Qt applications, and it is probably one of the most powerful GUI modules in Python. It comes with a ton of different widgets, and it's super easy to do stuff like multithreading with it. I personally like to use Qt Designer to create the GUIs, and then I use `pyuic5` to convert the `.ui` files to `PyQt5` code. - `colorama` - `colorama` allows you to easily add color to your command-line programs. Thats basically it. - `json` - The `json` module allows you to parse `json` into a Python dictionary, and then write a Python dictionary into JSON. Useful when paired with `requests` for getting API data, and just a useful module to know about in general. - `rich` - Rich allows you to create really nice looking console output, you can make errors look nice, render markdown, progress bars, and a ton of other stuff. It has support for 4-bit color, 8-bit color, Truecolor, and Dumb Terminals. I would really recommend checking it out. - `numpy` - NumPy is really good if you need to handle large amounts of data. NumPy also provides high-level mathematical functions to operate on these large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Since a lot of it is written in C, it is super fast, and the only downside really is that the arrays are stored completely in memory, so it's pretty easy to run out.**By popular demand:** - `itertools` - Itertools it's definitely an extremely useful module. It is used for creating iterators in a really easy way. For example, you can get all possible combinations of length `x` of two lists, get all the possible permutations of an iterable, and other really useful things. I should probably look more into this module myself.In conclusion, there are a lot of different modules, and these are definitely not all of the useful ones, or even all of the ones that I use, but I figured that those are some nice modules to at least give you inspiration. You could also check out my GitHub for inspiration, if you wanted, and I have a few Python modules myself.

Have a quick browse and see what's there.The most useful built-in ones, that are useful to nearly all aspects of Python, are `itertools` and `collections`. To some extent `functools` and `dataclasses` also, though they are not super useful immediately, but very useful to know about.- `itertools` provides advanced ways to combine, slice, flatten and group iterables and cycles. The `product()` function is very powerful, and can often replace nested for-loops in a compact way.- `functools` contains decorators that help you easily create classes that can be sorted, memoize functions, etc. There are many videos on how to utilize dataclasses and functools to create easy, maintainable, and powerful objects with ordering.- `collections` contains a plethora of useful utility tools. It has the `Counter` class, that can wrap an iterable and count the amount of each element, and return the top N most common items. It also provides `defaultdict`, which is a dictionary where unknown keys will have a specified default value. Saves you from writing code to check existence and initialize. Finally the `deque` object is a wrapper around a list, that supports lightning fast appends and pops, and the ability to rotate the lists.For real-life scenarios, you'll quickly run into `requests` whenever you need to do interact with some website. It's a third-party plugin that builds on top of urllib, and removes the need for tons of boilerplate code. The `os` module will also be your way for interacting with the file system, together with `pathlib` and `glob` in some scenarios."

For example, if you have a list of integers, and you want to obtain their counts, you could build something yourself, or just:     >>> import random    >>> from collections import Counter    >>>    >>> x = [random.randint(0, 10) for i in range(20)]    >>> x    [0, 4, 8, 10, 7, 5, 9, 10, 2, 6, 7, 2, 0, 10, 9, 1, 8, 10, 7, 0]    >>>    >>> counts = Counter(x)    >>> counts    Counter({10: 4, 0: 3, 7: 3, 8: 2, 9: 2, 2: 2, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 1: 1})    >>> counts[0]    3    >>> counts[9]    2the built-ins usually perform better than what I would have built, `itertools` is another good one, powerful stuff"

These will give you a lot of power scripting on your local machine and interacting with the OS and local file system.Me personally, most of my programming work involves integrations between systems and moving/manipulating files of various formats, or delivering data to a 3rd party.   For me, these libraries are must-haves:  `requests` - anything HTTP, really useful for web API's.  `paramiko` - a really good SFTP library.  `ElementTree` or `lxml` - working with XML files.  `json` - most API's use JSON data   `csv` or `pandas` - working with delimited text data.  `glob` - great for using wildcard pattern matching for filenames.  `re` - regular expressions; invaluable when needing to do certain manipulation of data or extracting odd-ball pieces of data from files.  `smtplib` - sending emails.  A lot of my automations and integrations use this for notifications or generating tickets."

Most people who claim they're \"hard\" have never really sat down to study what they are and how they work. They're really simple once you \"get it\". I've cleaned up and condensed hundreds of lines of code down to 10-15 lines of code using regex.The big issue is python `re` is not really complete compared to stuff like PCRE/C regex. The built in regex engine is also slow. There are some other regex libraries that address these. But generally speaking, you can get 99.9% of regular expression work done with the normal library.Capture groups and named capture groups are insanely powerful.I'd recommend learning regexes, then working on solving problems with games like \"regex golf.\" (google it)"

I use `.glob()` all the time, as well as `.relative_to()`, `.with_suffix()`, and my fingers type `path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` on their own by now."

I decided to go a bit further and make it \"usable\", request the user imput for the number of months, request the amount of money, only accept numbers as an input or throw an exception error and then store each month in a list and print the entire list at the end. So i learned lists, variables, userinput, exception error, while functions, and a lot more, I think this is how all learning is done, you should be proactive in searching and finding what you wanna do and have in your program, taught me a lot of things from further ahead in the course by quickly googling an idea and applying it to the project."

FastAPI is by design, asynchronous (it can handle requests asynchronously, so that your app doesn't hang when a particular request takes longer to resolve)The idioms are different too though. With flask, you use the `route` decorator to create new routes, with an argument for the verb of the request that route is allowed for ('GET', 'POST', 'PUT' etc). FastAPI has one decorator for each of these verbs (`app.get`, `app.post` etc). Furthermore, FastAPI generates a `/docs` route that autodocuments your app based on type hints and docstrings.Type hints are a requirement in a FastAPI app, since it's how the framework determines which is the type of the argument, and how it sends the body of the request to a pydantic model/schema."

Which means that it simplifies a lot of the database stuff by mapping it and objectifying it, using models (I'm still learning as well so I might confuse you with a half explanation so I'll keep it to the basics).    A silly example: Instead of using SQL syntax you could get a list of all the records using a list comprehension from a generator like `firstnames = [x for x in Users.firstnames]` where `Users` is the table model and `firstname` is just the column name.    To store a new record you do something like `Users.insert(firstname=\"Has\", lastname=\"been dead\").execute()` and that's it. You don't have to define connections, cursors or anything to work with your database, except creating the database model (which is automatically created by a CLI command from an existing database)."

For example, a really useful tool within itertools is [itertools.combintations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations) which returns all of the combinations of items within a given iteratable. The nice thing about itertools is that because it is apart of the python standard library under the hood it is written C++ so it is much faster then any pure Python version you could write."

It can also generate values from many different probability distributions, for example uniform (which is what `random` uses), but also normal, exponential, gamma, and many others. It can also generate numbers from an interval with the endpoints either included or excluded. You can also sample randomly from a distribution either with replacement or without (also possible with `random`, but requires two separate functions which is annoying). And none of this is even scratching the universe of what else is possible with `numpy` apart from `numpy.random`, like boolean masking (=selectively filtering your data using logical arrays), and every mathematical operation you’ve ever heard of, again using inputs of any degree, and all blazingly fast.To see the overview, start a Python shell, `import numpy`, and type `dir(numpy.random)` into your terminal. And if overall you’ve just never heard of numpy or are unfamiliar with what it does generally, type `dir(numpy)` and BEHOLD!No matter what you’re trying to accomplish, when in doubt, always check first to see if it can be done using `numpy`. More often than not, it can."

The bigger issue is going the other way (hardcoding \"\\\" on windows systems)."

I went to download it from the official website and wondered why there are two different versions, but decided to go with Python 3 because it was the latest. Then I found out that the old tutorial I was using was actually Python 2, but was able to figure out the differences and still follow along. The only thing I had to change at that level was the print statements."

They also make amazing programmers later because they have a unique approach to problems from the typical logical first person.

                "comment": "As someone whose been trying to learn python / general programming for the last 4 years+, I’ve recently had a realization that a lot of it is muscle memory. The same problems show up again and again, only with different variable names. And when you first start out, you don’t know how to solve anything. But once you struggle and finally solve a problem, it feels great. Later, you may struggle again on the SAME problem (with different variable names), and that’s okay. Once you solve that, you may or may not realize it was the same problem. But, let’s say on the 10th time struggling to solve a problem, something clicks. And you realize you’ve solved the same problem over and over again. That’s progress. That’s the muscle memory kicking in, and the development of intuition. In my experience, academic classes go too fast through too many concepts for the development of intuition. This intuition takes a lot of practice, concentration, pain, time, and sleep to develop. When I was in school I didn’t feel like I had an intuitive understanding of anything until usually I was forced to relearn something again and again for the next course. Or sometimes I’d just be doing some mundane task and I’d think about some concept and it would just click. Don’t beat yourself up about it. It’s normal. The worst thing you can do is isolate yourself from others in shame. Try and explain the problems you’re working on to a neutral friend, and sometimes that helps, even if the person only listens. Try and stay afloat academically, practice as much as you can. Let the problem solving muscle memory develop. Most importantly, ask from help from the instructor, classmates, or random strangers on the internet. https://pythondiscord.com/"

The people who are best in their fields, mathematicians, programmers, musicians, whatever - they are best because when they recognise that feeling you have right now, they lean into it, because they know that is what your brain rewiring itself feels like.  Yes, it is tough and draining.  It requires a lot of grit to come back every day and feel like that.  But if you can learn to seek out that sensation and welcome it you will go a very long way.  Most people do it for a while and just coast."

I think the best solution is to get a personal tutor who can walk you through every question that you may have. Tutors can get expensive but you can find a freelancer tutor from india/pakistan for around $100 a month which imo is worth it. In that month you will learn all the basics so you can make better use of the online courses after. Also, specialized learning is helpful."

I am on the self learning track also and focusing on one language and one tutorial has helped me make a huge leap forward.You don't need to know a lot of math to start learningAnother thing is learning to use code to solve problems. You can't just mindlessly type code and expect something to come from it. You have to have a specific problem you're trying to solve.For example what is the 86th entry in the fibonacci sequence? You can write a couple of lines of code to solve this problems instead of doing the calculations yourself.You're not going to breeze through a tutorial while having lunch and expect to pick it up. At least I can't. A lot of times I need to give studying my undivided attention.&#x200B;TL:DRJust keep going."

By the time they're able to teach the subject, they're many years removed from being a beginner themselves and likely forget what their first steps felt like.  This is actually something I've thought about quite a bit, and I've got some issues with how nearly every class teaches coding to beginners.  Several years ago I dropped out of college because of an \"intro\" CS class that was way over my head, but later decided that I still wanted to learn how to code.  I spent the next several years taking online classes (TeamTreehouse.com), reading books, then took a 3 month bootcamp course.  Every class seems to take  similar approach- they jump straight into teaching concepts and a language simultaneously without differentiating between the two.  They also start with very small topics without providing any context how these small pieces fit together to make an entire project.  It's like handing you one puzzle piece at a time without showing you what the finished puzzle will look like or even how big it's going to be.  It makes it very daunting and overwhelming when you're just starting out.  By the time I took the bootcamp course, I was pretty well prepared from all of the previous classes and took, but I watched many other classmates go through the same stress and hurdles that I did.  This approach to teaching just creates the habit of beating your head against a brick wall until things just click one day.  I'd recommend taking some time to just read up on concepts (loops, variables, arrays, dictionaries, functions), but try to ignore any actual language.  These are concepts that apply to nearly all languages, so they're more fundamental than the actual syntax of a language.  Check out [https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  It seems a bit childish, but it's a great way to practice using these concepts without getting bogged down by the syntax at the same time.  Once you get comfortable with that, try finding some resources that will break down file structures of projects and explains what each file does, and then move onto the actual syntax of a language.  And of course, practice practice practice.   Think of simple projects that will allow you to practice.   I wrote a simple script to help me budget and track bills.  Not only was it a good place to start, it has real world value and I still use it all the time.   Let me know if you have any questions."

Never took any classes and learned by simply figuring shit out as I went. Also, the highest grade I ever got in high school algebra was a C but I honestly think it is because everyone learns math completely differently because when I look at things now through a different lens they click but they would have not made sense to me in school. I don’t say any of this to humble brag by any means either, I had the exact same “what the hell am I doing even attempting this?!?” moments too but looking back now the only thing I regret is that I waited so long to start learning because I convinced myself I couldn’t before I tried. Here’s the thing, you can do this. My guess is that you are getting yourself overwhelmed trying to learn to much at once. Programming is intimidating at first because there are LOTS of options. There are almost always multiple ways to tackle a problem, sure some may be better than others but you can usually get from point A to point B multiple ways and as you become a better coder, you will learn why different solutions are better than others. Don’t get discouraged! You can learn on almost any device these days and there are so many free resources available. The best thing I can suggest to you is to find a project and then start learning the pieces you need to make it work. Don’t get frustrated by what you don’t know, ask questions, be humble and things will start to click!"

This eventually ends up discouraging them because they haven't cemented the basics. If this you, I would suggest that you start with very simple projects and work from there to hone and sharpen your programming skills before you take on any advanced projects. I promise you will get there  eventually, but you definitely need a good grasp of the basics to get there and some patience. Cheers!"

I studied countless YouTube videos, took several Udemy courses, and this is what helped me the most and I feel got me pointed in the right direction. The cost is minimal, btw. [https://www.udemy.com/share/101txwBkUZdVlbRnw=/](https://www.udemy.com/share/101txwBkUZdVlbRnw=/)I've found I have to go back and review it every now and then. Speaking of reviewing, one of the Python YouTubers that I liked a lot made the point that there is such a vast number of Python libraries and commands that it is impossible to remember them all, so get familiar with how to search on them and don't feel badly about having to do so."

I was one of the few people who failed the test and exams yet managed to salvage it and pass thanks to my mates as the course was 70% coursework. I stopped coding for about a year, then decided to give it another go. It wasn't easy at first cause I had to relearn everything. Then one day something clicked in me. Now I can right simple scripts. Nothing ridiculously complicated or even remotely complicated, but still... My friend once told me, \"coding is a way of thinking\".Good luck and keep going."

There are a ton of computer science sites put there designed to teach concepts, my favorite is [Codeabbey](https://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_list). Challenge yourself, try and solve as many problems as you can in a month (without cheating, because you will only be cheating yourself) then report back if you are still having issues learning."

It not only talks about what different things do but it shows examples, has you feel in some missing pieces, quizzes you, has you write most of the code for what your learning. The paid version has related projects that focus on what you just learned, plus included in the paid version you have access to all of the different course Mimo offers. If i had the money I would buy the paid version. Just my worthless two cents,Unlovedcoder"

But people aren't really engaging with the specifics of a person's situation when they're just being generally motivational.If you've genuinely spent 2 weeks on something that is reasonably predicted to take ~3 hours, that could be indicative of a fundamental flaw in your approach or a basic gap in your knowledge.  Perseverance is definitely a necessary trait, but sometimes people can become fixated and there's a fine line between perseverance and unproductive stubborness.Try posting your assignment, what you've tried so far, and your obstacles/issues -- including specific error feedback -- to this sub and asking for help.Just blindly encouraging people to \"keep going\" or pointing them at other learning resources doesn't necessarily help.  They might be laboriously toiling up a mountainside when really they need a _specific_ nudge onto a smoother path right adjacent to them."

To use Python for certain things (such as AI development) you'll need to be good at math in general. If you get into doing  algorithms you'll be problem solving in similar ways as to what you would do in algebra. But learning the Python library, not at all, and depending on what you want to do with Python you don't need tons of math skills. If you want to develop websites using Python maths isn't really a concern. Some courses you can study are designed around computer science and engineering courses, these courses will tend to explain programming in a mathematical context to appeal to technical students. Stay away from courses like that if you don't have a passion for math. It might not sound appealing, but books designed for kids or high school students to learn Python isn't a bad route to do down if you are really struggling to find something, this will give you the foundational knowledge to progress into more challenging material."

You read something 5 times and know you are not comprehending. You get lost in the tutorial and can't get a pice of code to work. It shuts you down and shuts you off because no one likes feeling stupid. No one likes feeling new. The best tool I've got in the toolbox now is consistency. Consistency day in and day out will eventually lead to results. Even if you can only tough out an hour just force it. Something ive found is that ill feel like im getting nothing but then when watching a different tutorial I'll realize I DO know what's supposed to be happening and I just have to figure out how to execute. Its a lot of thinking and staring. Also- try to explain the concepts to someone else. Itll help you to solidify your personal definition of these terms. You are far more likely to have the information stick if you can do this. Tell your mom,  your SO or the cat but just try to explain it in your own words. I think when you memorize definitions word for word you are only memorizing you are not fully learning. In conclusion- Just keep going. Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. Meaning even if you were good out of the gate you won't get any better without putting in the time. If this shit was easy everyone and their mom would be at Google making 6 figures already.

It's overwhelming at first but trust me, you will get it with enough practice.Personally i really do believe in the learn by doing method. I would find an easy project or something that you're generally interested and just jump in and try to code it. It could be as easy as a program which take an input number from the user and multiplies it by two, or something of that nature. And just keep adding onto the program, make it take multiple inputs. Adding some error catching, etc. etc.From my experience, i felt like i could read material for hours and it never really clicked until i actually coded something out on my own.

It also takes time. If you haven't touched algebra in years, you need to give yourself some grace and focus on learning, not on how much time it's going to take.I have a learning disability, barely graduated college, and now I'm a chemical engineer that's starting to learn data science. Graduate schools don't want me because my undergrad GPA is too low. Isn't that funny? I'm doing more work and learning more than my colleagues, but I'm not worthy to be educated at a university. Traditional concepts of education are bullshit. You're going to hit every obstacle and you're going to fail and fail often. The people that get the furthest are not the smartest but the most stubborn.Keep grinding!!"

                "comment": "Honestly, I've been where you are.  A lot of programming languages that aren't HTML or CSS style building tools involve a lot of math, but the good news is, that most of what you need to know math wise isn't necessarily how to perform equations, but how to think about the result you want, and how to get to it logically.  I am horrible at math, and I'm pretty good at python, because I don't necessarily have to do math, I just have to know what result I want and how to look for it.1. You should download  [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) , it has a utility called Jupyter Notebooks that allows you to code and run your code all in one page, making it much easier to see results quickly for code you write without having to resort to using  a text editor and testing at the command line level.2. I highly recommend this course: [https://www.udemy.com/share/101W94AEEfclxXQH4H/](https://www.udemy.com/share/101W94AEEfclxXQH4H/) (since there are other comments recommending courses, this one is very recent, so everything in it is inclusive of the language the way it stands at the moment). The teacher approaches it from a complete novice standpoint, every single section has a fully complete manual you can read through while the videos are playing, or you can code along with the video, which I found extremely helpful when learning python.Additionally, this website is excellent for self practice once you've got the basics, and it's completely free.[https://www.practicepython.org/](https://www.practicepython.org/)3. Remember that one of the biggest open secrets of coding is that you should never try to reinvent the wheel just for the sake of it.  If you need to solve a problem that someone else has already solved, then use their solution.  Google the issue, if someone has a fix, just copy and paste it, then look at their fix and try to understand what it's doing, and why it works.  This is also an easy way to learn, via reverse engineering.4. Try to remember that you're learning a language, with it's own syntax, vocabulary, and logic.  If you tried to learn French in 2 weeks, you wouldn't be surprised if you were still terrible at it.  Learning languages takes time.  On the bright side though, once you learn one language, picking up others is easier, because they all share similar traits.Coding isn't for everyone, but without the right resources, you won't know, so do yourself a favor and grab a good course, and give it another month."

Automate the boring stuff it is a great one.Other than that, be patient. Programming is like going to the gym. The firsts weeks you are going to lift 2 to 5kg as most, but after weeks of repetition you are going to be between 15-20kg. But, if it happens that you start to skip the training, you are going to start all over again. Programming is the same, be patient, consistent, and in few weeks you are going to be using classes and that kind of stuff."

                "comment": "Hey dude!  Programming languages are weird.  I've been programming since C in the early 90s, and I still have trouble getting started trying to learn a new one.  So I'm all too familiar with the feeling of putting effort into trying to learn it, but the pieces just don't come together, and you start feeling like \"this is wrong and it's stupid and I'm stupid and I hate it.\"  You will likely get that feeling, I do and lots of people do, so there's no stopping it, but the key is to ignore it.  Ignore your feelings!Then the next thing: I think you have to understand how you learn.  Meaning, how do *you personally* learn things easiest, and then find a python course that explains things in *that way.*  For example, I can learn about what variables are and how loops work, and it is important to understand them, yes. But at some point, I need to learn by *doing* rather than just reading about concepts.  So usually, getting started in a language, very early on I'll try to write a program that does something I do a lot, maybe batch-rename a bunch of files.  And then just google away about how to do something like that in the language I'm trying to learn.  Along the way, I'll see \"Oh, they're using a loop here -- I remember reading about those\" or \"oh I see they're using a variable, but the syntax is different.. hmmm maybe I'll google what that is too.\"  From there, I can usually get into the \"groove\" of things.Also, and this may be more controversial, but a lot of courses I've seen start you off by `pip install`-ing a bunch of third-party libraries and using those.  I think that's a really bad way to start off, because you're not learning python; you're learning how to use some third-party thing that some dudes wrote in their pajamas and of *course* it's not going to be as well-designed as the programming language itself.So that's just me, but I'm saying that the key to learning a programming language (or anything) is going to be:1: Ignore your feelings of doom. They're normal at this stage and they're meaningless.2: Figure out how *you* learn best, and find a good course that works the same way you do."

Anything very simple.Eventually, you'll get the hang of the syntax, the pythonic ideals, and the language benefits.Then, you'll be motivated to do more.This is when you simply start googling what you want to achieve and you'll see modules or libraries or stack overflow or Reddit questions on the same.The beauty of Python is it can do anything and there's always something that exists that you can pick and use.At this stage, you may continue the projects or do some leetcode or hackerrank exercises and you'll be good.It is arduous but a fun journey and anyone can pick it up ;)"

I completely ignored it after a few failed attempts.I'm a few days away from turning 38. I recently picked up Python and I'm making some (but satisfying) progress. Go into the basics using the online courses, then try watching the fun, Python Youtubers - sentdex, Corey, Tim. They give you nice bite-sized lessons in 5-10mins. Don't over do it. Practice some. When you've gone through a few of those, try to find things (outside Python) that you find annoying or you feel, take too much of your time. It could be cleaning up data and plugging them into sheets, sorting your media folder, maybe killing a few processes before you start gaming, maybe a device status monitor. I mean, you figure!Simplify, automate them using Python. Start with the simple stuff. You will be surprised when you find yourself going overboard trying to get something to do. Those difficult small steps expose you to much more than any Youtube, or spoonfed courses ever will. You will make a lot of progress, than tackle the bigger problems."

I have a liberal arts background with zero experience in computer science but wanted to pick it up to be better at my job as a linguistic data analysis. The most important thing i learned is that this, like everything hard, takes a lot of time. Here's what worked for me:1. Get a mentor/buddy - I owe EVERYTHING to my work mentor who would have the patience to sit with me for 30 mins every week and umm and uhhh until i figure out the simplest shit. She would come up with an idea, let me work on it for a week, and then we would solve it from scratch together. This laid the foundation. 2. Make small progress - Even when you get the basics down, there are a million things to learn. I like to write down things i dont know and when i have down time reference that list and learn something new. Relatedly...3. Read read read - For a while I would read a python article (medium/towards data science, mostly) first thing in the morning. Sometimes i would try it out right there, sometimes i would read just to give myself more input. You'd be surprised how much stuff sticks that way. 4. Try to do things from memory after you learn them - this was big for me. A lot of times i would see someone do something (at work, in a youtube video, etc. ) and understand it but not know what the fuck to do when i was asked to do it myself. I like to black out the code in my notes and just write the thing i \"learned\" how to do, then try to do it from memory a few times before i took off the black highlight. 5. Lastly, ask for help - people love this shit & they love to share. There will always be someone who's willing to help if you're humble and ask nicely."

Their teaching method is simply \"learn A, then learn B, then learn C, then learn D\", etc. Which seems good, but is actually really bad. The problem is, you are not really remembering and understanding things, you're just watching, going through the motions, and then moving onto something different (and it all washes off you).You learn by practicing. You need to do simple things, over and over and over again, until you are thoroughly sick of them. Then you need to do them way, WAY more.Pick a simple console game, like \"guess a number, and I'll tell you if your guess is too high or too low, until you get it right\". Or hangman if you want something more challenging.See if you can make that. If you can't, learn inputs and conditional flow until you can. If you can, great. Now make it again. Now make it again. Now swap it around (i.e. computer guesses your number, instead of the other way around). Now make it again, but move code into functions, and have a simple main game loop that calls the functions (this is called refactoring: the game works the same, but the code is organised differently). Now make it again. Good job.Tomorrow? Go through that whole process again.See? You're probably getting very sick of this number game by now. That's a good sign you're on the right track.Go check out Learn Python the Hard Way. It is based on a similar philosophy: simple boring exercises, done over and over. No copy and pasting. Type out simple functions by hand, over and over, until they become like muscle memory.Before you yell out \"but programmers don't to memorise everything, searching on stack overflow is fine!!!\", I know that. But there is a certain level of intrinsic knowledge that you simply need to have a baseline level of productivity. If you need to google how to define a function every time you define a function, you will annoyed and give up. This way, you will end up getting bored and annoyed, but by the time that happens, you will have picked up a bunch of tacit knowledge that will make your next projects 1000 times easier."

Sadly, it doesn’t go away, but you can learn to accept it and it helps. Don’t stop, there is a lot of truth in the adage “First step is always the hardest”. The more you do it, the more comfortable you will become.Programming has a relatively steep learning curve: you need to know syntax, think in steps, be familiar with command line, etc. It is also “trial-and-error” process with huge emphasis on “error”. It is normal when your code doesn’t work first several times when you run it. It is normal to stare at your code for long periods of time trying to figure out where you made a mistake. It is normal to google your bug for hours. This process goes against what we all learned in school where doing it right the first time is the goal. Don’t give up"

Immerse yourself, go through YouTube, go through free content hosted on Github, sign up for free courses, etc... Also just can’t rely on watching or reading, comes a time where you actually need to code yourself. Jot down notes as you go, you’ll have moments here and there where you get that aha moment.

And if you're further frustrated now because some of these replies look like little more than knowledge fetch quests, I don't blame you.  \"False starts and rabbit holes\" is a learning style that some people prefer - I'm not gonna knock learning styles, getting stuck occasionally is unavoidable - but it's honestly absurd the extent to which it's been assumed as the default learning style, and used to excuse poor teaching.&#x200B;Anyway, sorry for the rant, here are my explicit solutions to your problem:1. If you're in an \\*introductory\\* programming course (Python or otherwise), there shouldn't any need for you to learn/relearn algebra.  Python \\*can\\* get mathy, but an intro course shouldn't require more than a refresher on basic arithmetic concepts.  If someone's told you you need to take algebra lessons, they're either a bad teacher or you've unwittingly enrolled in a more advanced Python class.  2. Invest 4 hours of your time into the first two videos of Lynda's \"Become a Programmer: Foundations\" learning path (\"Programming Foundations: Fundamentals\" with Annyce Davis and \"Programming Foundations: Beyond the Fundamentals\" with Sasha Vodnik).  I cannot begin to express how many years of trying to learn programming in fits and starts could have been avoided if I'd have seen these two videos first.  They use Python as their main focus (so that's already a plus), but they also tie the material into larger programming concepts to give you transferable skills should you move on to other languages later.&#x200B;As a heads up: Lynda \\*is\\* paid (*$30/month*), but they do offer a trial month for free and a number of universities and library systems offer free access for students/members (even if they don't heavily publicize it) so those routes could help you sidestep the issue if you're on a tight budget.  (I'm currently using it for free through my local library)Hopefully this helps (and apologies if I unwittingly projected too much of my own experience into what you're going through)!  \\^\\_\\^;"

No matter how smart you are you'll find stuff that's hard.  That's in part because your brain has to physically build the circuitry required to be able to understand it.  It takes time and practice to do so. The truth also is if you can understand something immediately, you probably won't get paid much to do it.  Because if just anyone could understand it with little effort, I can probably do it so why would I hire you for a six figure sallary?It's the effort of diving head first into a tough task, building up the skills that many others haven't, and making yourself standout from the crowd is what gives your skill set value. That will mean you'll struggle.  That will mean you'll find moments you don't know what to do.  That's normal and to expect otherwise is just flat out unrealistic.But that struggle is what allows you to walk into a job interview and go \"yeah I'm the one you want to hire, because you ain't going to get this shit elsewhere!\" in a polite tone of course. :)"

I'm learning Python since November just from books and googling-fu, and I've already wrote like 12+ mini-software utilities for my Plex server, web scrapping, databases  and finishing a project atm for a business. I didn't have to use math for my use case, except +/- for transaction mechanics. So use case may vary. Unless OPs trying to learn something that requires math, OP can choose any other alternative learning path, and go with stuff like web-scrapping, or just getting grasp of non mathematical syntax. I've started with Python Crash Course, really well written. Automate the Boring Stuff is my second recommendation to skim through to reinforce the knowledge from the first book and learn few more utilities and see good use case examples in real life."

Technically it is for beginners and the lectures excellent, but the problem sets are very difficult and frustrating. To complete them you'll need to do a lot of research on things not covered in the lecture. It's difficult but you'll learn a lot. I felt dumb because each PSET felt overwhelming and took a long time to figure out. The Harvard students have access to study groups and TAs so they have help when doing the PSETs, you will only have Google, Stack Overflow etc.If you're coming from absolute zero, I suggest Automate the Boring Stuff from Al Sweigart. You can buy the book or read it for free on his website. I started CS50 in 2018 and had to put it aside many times because it felt way over my head. CS50 will teach you more about computer science than programming. What I did was to learn how to program first before returning to CS50."

I get that every program is different - so it can be hard to apply experience from one to another - but even assuming we ignore that most programs front load a lot of gen ed courses, I just don't think there's enough time.In my program, we did toy compilers in Computer Architecture.  I won't pretend to specifically remember the exact pre-reqs, but I think it was a 300 level course and I'm vaguely recalling it required at least: The 101 of whatever language is the core language for the university's program (Java, for me), Data Structures, and Algorithms -- and I'm fairly confident Data Structures had a Discrete Math pre-req too.All of that would have to be completed _before_ starting Computer Architecture.  So to be doing a compiler as, let's say, an end-of-semester project in your second semester, you would have had to take all three/four of those courses your first semester.  And that's assuming it wasn't actually a compilers class, which would definitely require more pre-reqs than a reasonable person could fit into their very first semester in undergrad.So, it's conceivable I guess, but definitely not common."

I wanted to customize the fuck out of my media server and seeing what Python can do, I realized programming's potential and I binged through Python Crash Course in ~78h, wrote my first 'skeleton' project based on my knowledge grasped from tweaking l3uddz software, borrowing few great modules. Studied plexapi module, instead of doing repetitions on tutorials. Basically for me taking code and tearing it apart was a way more fun experience than doing tutorials. This way I instantly applied my knowledge for my media server, and my other hobbies, giving me gratification for my accomplishments. Dopamine reinforcement, yay! Sorry, got sidetracked.So I rewrote a lot of stuff and made his software more windows friendly, added some functions, ported some from py2 to py3. Then wrote my own stuff. Added things like throttling for torrents, NVIDIA Shield/Parsec detection for bandwidth optimization and other little things. Then tried to create my own agent, disliked the result, created socket server (after 3 months upgraded to Sanic instead) and connected scrappers I wrote for websites with  requests and modified TVDB bundle to make request to server, which then scraps metadata I want and integrates to my library through plexapi module. I'm happy on my progress overall, still adjusting to writing better code.My plan is someday to read the git manual, and actually commit my changes to branch on github to support open source and the guy who unknowingly got me into programming."

I also really like your use of the `simple_parsing` library. When I was creating a CLI I actually would look at Pynguin for some guidance. I guess I just found navigating the repo to be a breeze.Also, just curious - can one give Pynguin an AST directly, instead of passing a file? And, is it possible to direct Pynguin to only generate tests for specific functions in a file? I never figured those two questions out."

I'm also a visual thinker, and I see the code before me as a landscape to walk through, so that becomes important for me when thinking through algorithms. To make the code more readable, I began structuring unnecessary statements into the scripts, like, superfluous stuff, e.g.: very specifically declaring the types of local variables; or regularly adding `continue`-statements in for-loops; or adding `# endif <code related keyword>` after if-statements. This helped, at least a bit. I later realized, that curly brackets, as seen in most C-derived languages, would have done a good job of visually isolating the components in the structure instead of the way I marked my for-loops, and the `endif`s were probably inspired through past experience in Fortran/IDL. I had basically recreated other languages' visual quirks within Python's ability: first by instinct, then very consciously, towards a noticeable improvement in my own visual flow. And so, of course, it clicked for me, how and why _other_ languages choose to _retain_ syntactic quirks; quirks that could be compared to as being inferior to-, or less modern than Python's own, even to the point of disarming my previously intense Python fanboy-ism(of course, such syntactic retention also spring from the fact that when \"something\" becomes implemented, and it works, no one wants to change how that \"something\" works, preferably \"ever\")However, that Python fanboy-ism reawakened when I later landed a job, where I was to learn and to do Cobol. The really weird thing is that I could easily see and feel the parallels in the \"design intent\" for both Cobol and Python as languages. In the end Cobol itself wasn't really the problem, but I couldn't stand working with the platform on which it runs, z/OS. In short, it felt as though my ability to code creatively was not only fading, but rotting. More and more, I longed for Python's elegance and ease of use, until I decided not to power through \"it\" [Cobol & z/OS] for any longer, and managed to change departments.(...and I'm still looking for my past \"spark\", joy for coding, and lust for problem solving. So if any of you happen to have any advice on something like this, I would appreciate anything you've got!) To sum it up, and to reinforce @OP's post, learning other languages will indeed let you appreciate Python's own quirks, but also the quirks of its \"parents\", \"siblings\", and even some of its distant cousins n-times removed!"

Say you are coming from Java or .NET and you want to iterate over list, what do you do? for loop with index variables. That's not pythonic. The entire concept of iterators and generators is more or less Python specific, unless you're are using external libraries.Or EAFP in general: not too many languages encourage this design pattern while EAFP is pythonic. Not many languages have default-yielding accessors either (`dict.get()`, `getattr()`. In ES5, the closest way is Oliver Steele's nested object access pattern that relies on `undefined` being falsey but that's still edgier: `obj.maybe_attr || default`. ).I remember about a couple decades ago when I was starting out with Perl and PHP, it was very common to instantiate \"variable variables\" (e.g. `${$var}`) which was a major way to do dynamic assignment. In Python you quickly learn to use dynamic dict construction to accomplish the same goal.Or recursion, which CPython is really bad at, requiring the use of iteration, vs. tail-call optimized languages in which you can happily recurse away.Later versions of ES seemed to be getting a lot of hints from Python, like decorators.Edit: Just because this post got me riled up, I decided to go read Raymond Hettinger's twitter feed. [Here's an example of an unpythonicity from OtherLanguage(tm)](https://twitter.com/Phaseit/status/1298675548491853824):    class Whatever:        def _blah(self):            # Actual implementation            ...                def blah(self):            self._blah()"

C for low level stuff because it doesn't hide the hardware; a lot of C++ stuff can be done in C with abstraction so learning C may make you familiar with a few keywords but you need to know how to create abstractions that are more natural in C++ - how could either help with python code.Eventually you'll forget a lot of stuff anyway so the only purpose is confidence building and a moderately faster learning curve because of the stdlib that needs to follow (for each language).Additionally languages change: C99 and new style Python classes or print keyword/function and you'd have to keep track of such things.One thing that is advantageous is familiarizing yourself with Unicode or Internationalization so domain specific knowledge!

I'd say this more to do with programming novices finding a way to do \"*dynamic variables\"*, rather than it being a recommended way. Perl and PHP both had hashes (dictionaries, associative arrays, what-have-you) but I suspect a large portion of the user-base - particularly in those early days - didn't really understand them or what to use them for.Case-in-point, I was recently asked by a novice to help out with their Python script, and found the code was littered with, eg. `vars()[name]`... So it's not something that's limited to Perl or PHP, but rather a limitation of a beginner's thought patterns.

And like I also said, there are some lifelong Pythonistas out there that demonstrate this, specifically here's [another example from Raymond Hettinger](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1254139958870171648):  that analyzes solutions for the very common question of \"How do I test if all elements of an Iterable are equal to each other?\". By putting together knowledge about Python, the theory of computation such as complexity and software engineering concepts such as interoperability and DRY:> Thinking about the problem abstractly, the minimal amount of work required is:> > * Examine input element one at a time> * Use `__eq__` to determine if it has been seen before> * Stop when a mismatch is found> * Keep only one other comparison element in memory[He notes that](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1254139958870171648) his favorite solution is:    def all_equal(iterable):        \"Returns True if all elements are equal to each other\"        g = groupby(iterable)        return next(g, True) and not next(g, False)because of the functions following properties:> * Accepts any iterable> * Single pass> * Runs at C speed> * Has early-out> * Only requires `__eq__`> * Minimal memoryas well as the Zen concept of [The usual thing to do is factor-out the solution into a well named function.](https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1254135046778220545)Another example: the Python API for [splitting strings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16645307/2718295). Compare it to the new hotness, Rust, which contaminates its namespace with [at least 4 methods to do the same thing](https://twitter.com/d_merej/status/1271721529659842562)."

From what I've seen on this subreddit, many of the readers and poster are beginning self learners. While learning other programming languages may introduce some other stylings into their code, it also helps them see why doing things the pythonic way is a good thing. Most people, especially ones who are learning on their own, don't just \"study more abstract computational and software engineering principles\", it's not helpful. A lot of people learn best by doing.&#x200B;As for the engineering principals you mentioned, DRY and KISS are quite common. I wouldn't say python pushes them more than any other language. They are lessons to be learned by everyone who goes on this journey, not just python programmers. As for EAFP, although that is a more specific python paradigm, it isn't something that I'd fear to be lost by tinkering in other places.&#x200B;Finally I want to say that I'm not sure what the code example you gave is supposed to illustrate or add. I don't think saying an experienced Pythonista can solve a problem is a good yard stick for people starting out."

There is very little \"on top of C\" the way the python and many other languages handle some of the machine's details.There are definitely people that write C, but it's mostly just people writing firmware for embedded systems or the very small portion of the population that is doing things like inventing Python and Linux.In our modern world, computers are fast enough that the slowdown from using an interpreter or JVM is probably not worth the time to write and debug an entire program in C. Technically, you *could* do anything in C, but you *could* just write in binary too :)From an educational standpoint it's probably a great language. I have barely written any pure C, but writing C++ is definitely educational (especially if you stick to older standards)."

It's a lot easier to enjoy coding (or anything, really) when you find interesting projects to work on and care more about building things rather than just learning to code for the sake of learning to code. It gives the learning a sense of purpose. The thing is that when you first start out, you're too inexperienced to think of ideas for neat projects because you might not know how to navigate APIs, basic language features and constructs, syntax, how state is managed by a software application, etc.. To learn this, you have to push through the tedium. :-)"

For example, I didn't know what the sum sign (sigma) is at 18 years old; I've never seen it until then.  I remember the Assistant Instructors in my class looking down on me around this time and I was questioning if I should even be in college.  I ended up graduating with a 3.9 GPA and most likely earn more than 90% of my graduating class.  I remember running into that same assistant instructor as we interviewed for the same job a few years later, and I had numerous internships under my belt at this time and was a better candidate than him despite him being my senior and I'll never forget the look in his eyes; he seemed like he couldn't believe I was doing so much better than him; angry, almost.&#x200B;Sorry for the rant, I think it's relevant though; don't let others make you doubt yourself.  As for speeding up learning, as soon as you learn the basics, create something you're passionate about.  Something that you'd use in your day to day life.  Do this for 2 reasons: &#x200B;1) Creating projects from front-to-back are the best ways to learn how to develop professional code.  You'll run into many obstacles and learn how to pass them, and after building a few applications you'll have a much more professional skillset than if you simply followed a course.&#x200B;2) You'll be much more motivated to keep coding something you're interested in or that is useful.&#x200B;Hope that helped a little, good luck!"

However, the process is similar to solve a crime I guess. You look for clues, hints. Follow leads on the next possible module that is the reason of the issue. Also, it's in debugging that you learn most. Realize mistakes. Over time realize patterns that cause issues and so on"

PyQt seemed to be the best in my opinion for desktop apps, and for the most part yes you can build a GUI for most scripts.  Automation related scripts absolutely (that's what I'm building currently) and Cybersecurity I'm not too sure but most likely."

Even if you're forgetting a lot, you're remembering *some* and that's what matters.  Keep at it, get over that little hump where everything feels foreign, and once you have even a basic understanding it will open up a whole different perspective.  Good luck"
